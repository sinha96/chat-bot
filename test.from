The only way I know how is to modify the save file so that you ruler was actually born at some point in the future. Because the game doesn't check if the ruler should be alive, it is impossible for him to die until that date.

This was pretty much my only complaint about the chromas. Back in the day, a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the 'bucket fill' option. newlinechar  newlinechar I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together. Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each. newlinechar  newlinechar Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need. newlinechar  newlinechar Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.
My hypothesis: Journalism realizes that their ship is sinking. They try to use their positions to prove that they are able to bend whatever 'truth' there might be in any shape or direction possible. There is no objectivity, right? Guess that's just healthy business instinct. The real money lies in PR and political spin doctoring and social media astroturfing, not in 'journalism'.
It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are 5814 offenders newlinechar  newlinechar 52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number newlinechar  newlinechar 24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are 245,532,000 whites in America newlinechar  newlinechar There are 41,600,000 blacks in America newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get: newlinechar  newlinechar 1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013 newlinechar  newlinechar 1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita. newlinechar  newlinechar

I used to work at a university and one of the professors in the department had a deer ass mounted on her office wall behind her desk.

School is considered a social setting. So therefor OP has no reason to not introduce himself.

It's an exercise in semantics showing that you can't say that the average player in league X makes the average wage in league X. That's what OP said, and that's what I've been refuting. newlinechar  newlinechar More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals. newlinechar  newlinechar Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player. newlinechar  newlinechar Can that be true? newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're a player with a choice of one or the other, and you care about getting a higher wage, which do you chose?

I imagine this is all just has to do with tolerance.  If you gradually increase your dose then I imagine your tolerance would match it to stop the dose from being strong enough to damage dopamine receptors.

Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth. newlinechar  newlinechar Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually. newlinechar  newlinechar When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.

I will echo what others have suggested. newlinechar My $.02  newlinechar My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was 'free', the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat). newlinechar Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k.  newlinechar My wife constantly gets complements on her sapphire btw.

But now suddenly something that was intended to cost money doesn't. It sure sounds nice but then again so does having free anything. The game you are playing is free to play and Riot is a company so they want to make profit. Does it seem like robbery to you to pay for these skin? Maybe but it's still not 10% of the robbery companies like ubisoft are commiting so just live with it. Different ways for payment (like 1 at a time) are reasonable proposals but free stuff is a lot to ask for.

Could you please show me where in the TORAH this is taught? Teshuva is outlined multiple times, and it involves atonement for sin. For example, see Leviticus 5:5-6, Leviticus 5:15-16, Leviticus 6:4-6. newlinechar  newlinechar Teshuva is turning back to YHWH, making restitution to remove the guilt, and then offering sacrifice to atone for the sin. newlinechar  newlinechar Lev 17:11: 'For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It is THE BLOOD that maketh an atonement. newlinechar  newlinechar You can make restitution with your fellow man, and repay what you owe, or have transgressed in, but this does not bring atonement. Recompensation covers the GUILT of your offense against your FELLOW MAN. Atonement covers the CONDEMNATION unto death that YHWH has judged you with. You must be forgiven on both accounts. Recompensation is not teshuva. You must also be forgiven by YHWH himself. newlinechar  newlinechar Could you show me where in the Torah atonement is made without a life being given for your own? Sin brings death. When you sin, you are worthy of death, and blood must be shed, this is a Torah principle, and it is immutable. How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice? If you cannot prove your position from the TORAH, then it is invalid. Isaiah 8:20 says: newlinechar  newlinechar 'To the torah and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word it is because there is NO LIGHT IN THEM.'

Let me put it another way. Not winning a championship this year doesn't decrease how great a teammate and how unselfish he is, would it? That's an intangible thing that has been there his entire career. I don't think winning a 6th ring would add much more weight to that than there's already been. newlinechar  newlinechar So my argument would still be that winning a ring this year doesn't influence his legacy a huge deal. He's already got a great legacy and in the conversation for 'best big ever'. Getting another ring on a smaller role wouldn't change much. If Malone had gotten his ring with the Lakers, I wouldn't consider it changing his legacy much either.

Right, what I mean is get the customers you need first, then order the product. Like you said, pre-order. Set a threshold that says 'if we can get x many people to commit to it, we will buy and then ship out, otherwise, your order will be cancelled, and we will not do the bulk buy.' newlinechar  newlinechar What I mean to say is it's only profitable for you if you can get enough units sold, or get a high enough price, and it's only worth it to your (potential) buyers, if you can give them the lower price, which means you might benefit from a system like what MassDrop does. Get the customers to commit to a pre-order, then if you get enough demand, the order goes through.

He's kneeling next to her bed, waiting for her to wake up and cupping her cheek with one hand while he pulls out his phone with the other. He glances at it long enough to dial the emergency services number, and quickly requests an ambulance at Tay's address.*

&gt; Fonseca says...  it was a moment to vent frustration over what they see as economic injustice... They profit off of us, he says, but they give nothing back. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, the idea that wanton destruction of people's businesses, property, and livelihoods can be reduced to 'vent[ing]' is as disgusting as it is laughable. Most immigrant small businesses operate on incredibly slim margins, and it isn't unheard of for much smaller crises than riots to force many to close their doors. In the LA riots of 1992, less than a quarter of Korea Town's businesses ever opened up again, to say nothing of the emotional damage suffered by the people who lived there. Calling rioting 'vent[ing]' is supremely reductive and frankly disrespectful to the people who invested their lives and the lives of their families to make their businesses possible and sustainable. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, I wonder how familiar the person being quoted is with the actual inner operations of Asian American small businesses. I wonder if he is aware that the majority of Asian American small business owners don't even take a salary and most of their employees are family members who don't get paid either. They literally pay the rent, utilities, and operating costs of their businesses, and pay the rent and utilities of their home, using whatever is left to pay for food and gas, and saving what small amount they can in order to pay for their children's education and very likely neglecting their own retirement. newlinechar  newlinechar There's a reason why Asian small businesses seem so insular: it's because they are literally family businesses wherein the 'employees' accept law-breaking hours, get paid in food and shelter, and literally live and work under the same roofs.

Haha, I'm trying my best to give you the benefit of the doubt but you're not making it easy. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not 'I thought Shirin's edit'. It's that the editors have repeatedly promised us of an uprising by the good people, and that the editors have deliberately made the good guys super-good, and the bad guys evil caricatures. There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as 'Don't worry, Rupert will pull through', but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero. When you have a shitty bootlist, making the audience hate the bootlist as much as possible is not the way to go.

Siltfin is an overpriced carddraw mechanic. Usually a card like Siltfin is meant for a midrange deck, not for an early game deck. Coldlights are ofcourse awesome for Murloc decks, but since you only have two of them, they are not a reliable card draw engine. Also, it increases the chance of your opponent drawing into an answer.
We got married at 26, but have been together since 22.

I was just joking because it's a common theme on reddit so I wanted to try on the STEM junkie persona. I actually have huge respect for what you do and thank you for what you're able to do for those people in your care; some situations would require much more self-discipline than I have myself. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a Molecular Biology and Applied Maths double major, so I definitely am part of the STEM crowd, but I don't actually feel the way I was impersonating. The only opinion I have that is slightly STEM-circlejerky is that psychology isn't a science in the same way that physics or biology is. I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, I hope my comments didn't bother you too much because they weren't  sincere!

Good analysis.  I do not think nefarian will see competitive play though, the variance is too great.  It isn't like shredder where you have a general sense you will get a ~2/2.

Well... yes. You can waive your 5th Amendment rights (potentially) by speaking to police officers without the guidance of legal counsel. But that's not what I mean. I think LEO's (and possibly others) have a special sort of clause about questioning when it's internal. If Internal Affairs  (or whomever) is investigating you, you can't 'plead the fifth' and not answer their questions about how you conducted yourself on the job. I think the flip side is that the information they may obtain can't be used against you for criminal proceedings - you may get demoted or suspended or whatever, but they're not allowed to turn that info over to prosecutors  (they have to collect their evidence on their own). Someone who knows more about this should probably elaborate/clarify.

I have little to no knowledge of programmin but I can imagine that programming for video games it VERY different than programming for a web site.

If that is what you really want to do then do it. Look on codeacademy.com and get some programming books on-line or from your local library.

Reading back what I wrote I totally sound like a cunt for something pointless. Sorry 'bout that. It's been a long day at work. But I kind of disagree as most of those accounts were dead in the water for a long time before people decided to scavenge for them. So it seems weird to believe that they exist as some sort of community account when literally no one cared that they existed for a long time until people 'needed' them. 
First it says 1-5, and then -2-7. does that mean it only goes to 7 as a secondary ability?
You are not sugesting that the 'angry reaction' have been voicless? It has been quite vocal. I do get what you wanted it to be but that was not what it was and it is very unfair to force a premise they did not operate within on them and then judge them based on what you wanted it to be. The people has indeed spoken, quite laudly, now it was the modders turn.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes it does have defintion but let's be honest, no free marked is actually free in the purest sense. A free marked does not gaurantee you the right to sell something in someones store but it gives you the option to try and get it into the store. newlinechar  newlinechar It is hard to have this debate without touching on the main point, which is if you should be able to charge for your work. newlinechar  newlinechar This comes back to it not being a debate. It was them putting forth their point of view. TB has allready covered most of the oposing views in another video and he holds many of them himself. They did not describe people who disagreed with them as any of the above, that was reserved for people turning the debate into a shit fest. Unless, of course, I missed something. In case I did I would be very glad if you could what point in the video they say that everyone who disagree with us are psycopaths. I really do feel you have to do some hard work to somehow feel this was aimed at you. newlinechar  newlinechar In Nicks case I would also be slightly dismissive towards people  sending me death threats for wanting to get money for something I put years of work into. Especially if this attitude was not reflected in those he interact with in the community. That would make me feel like I was being unjustly attacked by outsiders, without that neccessarily being true. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you watched his, TB, previous video on the subject? The only thing he defended was the idea that you should be able to charge for your work if you want to. The rest he slammed, included the issues of noncompatible mods.  newlinechar  newlinechar That would also depend on the implimentation, but patreon, twitch and gom tv all lets you charge for content without any of it going under. Spotify charges so does netflix, people pay.  newlinechar  newlinechar I didnt intend to. I dont think a paywall is the solution, at least not a blanket paywall in which you put all the mods behind. Neither is TB for that mather.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a get rich quick scheme, most modders would not have a financial motive to charge for their work because the earning would be to slim. Not to mention that many do it to learn about game developing in which case you want as many as possible to try it. Many more still would not want to charge because they, like you, are purists. There would be some competition sure, but fighting over change is hardly worth it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes as they should have been, like TB said, towards what Valve sugested. I was against that as well, still am. I just suport the notion that if you worked on something you should have the option to get paid for it. newlinechar  newlinechar Inevitable actually:D This is not one of those old norse myths where man is slave to the fates. Modding will in all likelyhood not be a huge cash cow for 99% of the involved modder, and in many cases it will be better for game companys to let modders make their games more attractive to a larger audience without them baring that audience from entry by charging for the mod as well as the game. It is far from inevitable that all games will charge huge sums for all mods. That only happens if people actually buy it and if you do you have nobody to blame but yourself. newlinechar  newlinechar

Ah... right, you can change it. I totally forgot about that :P Thanks for the answer. I forgot to put this on the main post (I knew i'd mess something up) but my NNID is my chosen name, and that's what appears during the game as your name, and I don't think I can change that.

I agree it is good to see this and a great year for cameras, I love how great the pictures and videos are now on small camera, my point is they are putting way too much effort in stuff that we would use once and never use again, we would mostly use the front camera for selfies. again not bad over done compared to how bad the speakers or the system skin usually are.

That's all valid too!!! I just honestly can't believe how much people have ripped you apart for this post. Not sure if they're just not fit/active to begin with or think you should just let yourself go or just not care how you look or what. Attraction is really important.

As silly as awards feel, and as much as the humble Airmen often don't care about (and may even resist) formal recognition, it is important to understand how important awards can be in a long-term career.  As we move into the new EPR system where only 15% can be 4s or 5s, it will be those awards that set you apart (or don't) from other Airmen.  If you ever want to do special duties, those awards will set you apart.  If you ever want to make SMSgt, those awards will set you apart. newlinechar  newlinechar And awards build awards.  You get coined, then you win a monthly, then you win a quarterly, then you win a yearly, and then these other awards come up and your supervisor already knows you're competitive AND has the package over half done from writing your previous awards.  Roll with it and good things can come of it.  Remember this when you're a supervisor too.  Your Airmen that don't know will need someone to look out for them, and of course, it isn't uncommon to use subordinate awards as one-of-many metrics to measure NCOs and SNCOs.  A SNCO who can show a pile of awards their subordinates have received is clearly doing something right  for their people.
See, I can talk to you.  What you're saying makes sense.   It's just the widespread misuse of the concept that makes me avoid it.  a person can't seem to have any sort of discussion with many without shifting definitions coming in to play to muddy and obsuficate the issue.

While I held my composure fairly well, it was obvious he was having a hard time trying to be comfortable - he kept asking me 'Does it look like i'm on drugs?' - i'd say to him 'Only because you're thinking about whether you look like you're on drugs' haha.  newlinechar  newlinechar People deal with different scenarios differently, but i'd personally wait until you're comfortable with it until you do it in a place like that!

The thing is, the cultures that practiced that sort of polygamy do the same thing when they're monogamous.  So that doesn't seem relevant.

Tim Duncan's so old he's getting young.
He hasn't had a solid year since the Vezina push in 12-13 where he had a. 924 Sv%. I'd imagine the Sharks will look to draft a goalie soon, probably higher up, considering they don't have any blue chip goalie prospects, and are pretty thin there. Maybe they go after Ilya Samsonov. There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one.

This article (along with many others) neglects to mention that their article was about differences in how men and women transition from PhD to post-doc. newlinechar  newlinechar That, to me, is a very relevant piece of information; they were writing about how the male and female experience differs, so the peer reviewer saying they could do with a male viewpoint is quite understandable, depending on how much of their manuscript was based on anecdotal and personal experience.

&gt;All that that shows is that saving humanity is preferable is preferable to not saving it. Assuming that that's not an option, prolonging the inevitable is seen as preferable to going quietly into the night. newlinechar  newlinechar But... then that's just straight up evil. It's the deliberate and premeditated murder of another human being(s) without even the dubious 'justification' of saving everyone else. Acknowledging that but excusing it through a utilitarian point of view opens up moral relativism, which is the ethics equivalent of saying 'well that's just *your* opinion.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This is essential what OP wants to debate; not so much the morality of sacrificing a child from a utilitarian perspective (because any utilitarian worthy of the name is obviously going to argue that it's morally obligatory) but rather whether utilitarianism itself is moral. newlinechar  newlinechar And there's the rub. Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil, which is *still evil.* It's a plainly amoral philosophy, and OP knows that or he wouldn't have said 'I know this is a utilitarian argument but...' That  'but' let's you know he's about to dismiss the problems with utilitarianism. Which means he knows it's wrong but doesn't care because *results* and you can't really argue against that.

Your concern is legitimate. Tell him you are aware of her, don't have an issue with him seeing other women (since that's what you agreed to and you're still fine with that), but that you have an issue with risking your health. The current situation is not acceptable to you so he has 3 choices: dump her, dump you, or start using condoms with you (the fourth choice of starting to use condoms with her is not acceptable because you have no way of knowing whether he is actually doing so). Be prepared that he may dump you. However I think he will respect you candor and dump her or just start using condoms with you. Good luck.

&gt;No its not, reality keeps on going when we our sleeping, and if someone stabs us in the heart in our sleep, we die, we don't keep dreaming. newlinechar  newlinechar I obviously meant the 'reality' we experience in dreams is dependent on us.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How the hell else could a consciousness exist without a context or realty to exist in?  newlinechar  newlinechar So hypothetically speaking, what if that's all there is? Say one's mind was an AI construct and one's reality was a simulation run on the same computer. An AI could perceive the simulation as external to it all the while being part and parcel with it, depending on its programming. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is, because gravity applies whether you are aware of it. If everyone in society agreed that gravity didn't exist, you'd still fall if you jumped from the window. You know really that objective reality exists, don't deny it. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just speculating honestly, but maybe objective reality =! reality independent of consciousness. In the case of a self-sustaining dreamworld, reality being dependent on consciousness would be objective, but can still be outside of one's control like gravity or my inability to grow wings.

Did you just get upped a dose? Every time that you are upped there can be the flare up and that sounds similar to the flare ups that I experienced. My worst flare up lasted for about two weeks and then my face improved.  newlinechar My only other idea would be that your skin is sensitive to the new moisturizer that you are using.

If the test was easy to fail because it requires a film to have a lot of characters and a lot of dialog, then the inverse of the Bechdel test (there must be two named male characters, they must have a dialog, it must not be about a woman) would fail as frequently as the Bechdel test does. This is not the case. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead, far more films pass the inverse Bechdel test than the Bechdel test. This illustrates the point of the Bechdel test quite clearly: representation of gendered characters in films is heavily unbalanced.

You're right, and I should have been clearer that I meant crust *with cornmeal* not made exclusively from it.

I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, but I think *Isma* is giving an accurate account of her faith.   Under Catholicism you can't just say something is so because *you* think it is so.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  'no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality.' He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority.

It's kind of nuts, that's why it's hard to follow.  The theory says that Tuesday Weld, sixties actress, was at the center of a satanic underground.

The guy who is talking about this theory is named Jeff Turner and there was an amazing documentary about him called I Think We're Alone Now.

Here are my thoughts on how EMDrive works that I posted on another thread. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I've experimented with a similar idea using objects instead of electromagnetic radiation. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The law of conservation is not being broken, instead what is happening is that the 'equal and opposite reaction' is happening at different time intervals. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What is essentially happening is that when the microwaves hit a wall, they push the device in that direction, and the reflected microwave then goes towards the cavity that is V shaped. This cavity causes the reflection to be only partially cancelled, and as it continues bouncing around it gets cancelled completely over time. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It takes small incremental steps, but with the billions of microwaves being reflected, it appears to be a continuous movement. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Try an experiment at home, get on a computer chair and lift your legs up. Now without touching the floor try moving the chair by kicking. Your chair will move due to friction, but if you notice, it will move forward then back. This device basically just slows down the 'going back' part. So, if you keep going forward faster than the chair wanting to go back, you can create movement in vaccuum/space. newlinechar

Exactly. I had to leave an abused home and move across the state to live with a man that I barely knew (my father). I worked hard in school, got good grades, etc. etc. and with that and my poverty, the government is paying for my education. BUT I still work part time while going to school and have no family support. If my financial assistance disappears, I don't have anyone except myself. For someone to say I'm privileged educationally is laughable. I have been nearly homeless multiple times in my life.  newlinechar  newlinechar But I am very grateful to live in a place that allows me to make money, get a paid education, and all the rest. I have the privilege of living in the USA as opposed to developing countries that don't allow women to have the same rights as men. I'm glad I am living here in the US.

Ballsy but deeply unstable as a Government and they'd be unable to get anything done. Minority Governments need to offer concessions for votes.

&gt; Many people would like to have some form of social and cultural stability. newlinechar  newlinechar And there's nothing stopping them from doing so.  Since the society you live in is defined by the network of relationships you have with other specific people, and isn't some abstraction that exists 'out there', all you have to do is choose with whom and on what bases to form relations with others.  If you want to reengineer the entire external world to match your preferences, though, you're SOL -- no matter how much you *want* the external world to conform to your vision of an ideal society, it will never actually be possible to bring this about. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; When you reject the universal you crater into subjectivism. newlinechar  newlinechar But subjectivism is a correct description of reality.  Ideals and values exist only in the minds of human beings; they can be useful tools for building one's own particular life, but attempting to universalize them will create only unnecessary conflict and wholly avoidable misery.

The major problem I see is that you would be attempting to hang your hammock with a near-zero suspension angle with respect to horizontal.  If you don't know why this could be very problematic, play around with the hammock hang calculator linked in the sidebar. (Hint - watch the suspension tension force as angle w.r.t. horizontal approaches zero) newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, the main point of a structural ridgeline is to create the same hammock sag every time you set up.  With your proposed system, the two hammock prussik knots would have to be totally repositioned each hang, unless the tree separation distance happened to be *exactly* the same as the last time you set up.  So what's the point of even having a structural ridgeline if you have to adjust the length every time you hang anyway?

When someone says 'based off the bible' the earth is 12,000 years old. They find this by using the book of genesis and the lineage of christ. Using an average for the lifespan of each generation. They arrive at the number 12,000. What the bible means when it says 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is 1 day means that god has no concept of time. It is a human idea to explain the way we perceive events.

&gt;LoL's meta and entire game structure is based on it's business model. newlinechar  newlinechar Elaborate. I don't understand. Are you trying to say that only portions of the entire champion pool are viable at a time so more skins sell? I don't think that's true. Most of the champions that are super good are good because of concept and not numbers, so they can stay relevant for a really long time.

You make a good point, however the hunt doesn't end because some hunter is killed by Gehrman. The hunt ends because the source of the scourge is wiped out.

Obviously none of this has been accomplished before because the Mensis ritual and Merog's Wet nurse are still around by the time we show up.

My partner researches MS blood rheology and genomics so credit to her for this info: newlinechar  newlinechar Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which lymphocytic infiltration causes destruction of myelin and axons. During the initial stages, inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate, resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability.  newlinechar  newlinechar While the cause of MS is yet be established, there are proposed theories, which include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, microbiological infections, and immunological lack of tolerance, leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007).  newlinechar  newlinechar The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). newlinechar  newlinechar Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007). newlinechar  newlinechar The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). newlinechar  newlinechar In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).   newlinechar  newlinechar If you'd like any more information or any of the full citations, just let me know.

I doubt it would have been that extreme. Souls games already had different state-of-beings that affected not only your stats, but your movements as well (i.e. soul form, hollowing and low equipment load, heavy equipment load) aside from an aesthetically altered state-of-being, which given this studios ability to design brilliant- looking monsters, a roleplaying element was all it needed to be, perhaps with a slower moveset and adjustments to stats that would hinder/enhance certain approaches to combat. There are hundreds of different ways to make it work, and I am not buying the fact they couldn't.

i hate when people say 6/6 on the finals stage is better than 6/10 (Kareem) or something similar. It essentially means that a player would be better off legacy-wise if they lost in the conference finals than the finals. Winning your conference should NEVER be held against you.  newlinechar  newlinechar Losing in the finals isn't a ding. It is a sign that you won your conference, and did better than 28 other teams in the league.  newlinechar  newlinechar I feel like the only reason we hold finals losses against players is because the greatest player happens to have none, and we assume that any characteristic of his career must be a positive. If the bulls beat Orlando in 95 and lose to the Rockets in the finals, is MJ's career somehow worse? He would have won more series, but losing in the finals would be a 'ding'. newlinechar  newlinechar Losing in the finals should never be a ding. LeBron carrying Cleveland through a terrible conference in 2007 and then being hopelessly overmatched in the finals isn't some failing of his as a player.

Is there fair and good reason for it to be an all female workplace?  If your applying to be a nurse, so few nurses are men the probability of an all-female nursing staff at a nursing home or similar is very high.  Even with out any sexism at all, select 10 nurses at random odds are you will get 10 females. newlinechar  newlinechar Is it a teacher position?  Again so few early childhood educators are men that it's highly probable to get an all female staff.  You shouldn't take this job because of the pedo-hystiria, not the sexism of the admin. newlinechar  newlinechar Her comments in isolation are meaningless.  The simple fact of all female staff is not.  You don't get all female staffs outside of nursing and child care with out significant amounts of sexism.  The admin may not be the sexist bigot, it may be one of the employees that makes the work place hostile to men.

My problem with the ending of Soul Eater is that friendship *did* have a place... and they just ignored it. They spent so long getting Maka, Black☆Star and Kid to work together as a team, and they spent the entire penultimate episode rescuing Soul because his and Maka's teamwork was so important... and then in the last episode they just threw that all away and had Maka beat the villain by herself. It didn't help that the penultimate episode built up hype for the final battle *really* well, but then the last episode was just kinda a let-down.

For me, the only way a sequel can affect the original is in a situation where the director is the same. For instance, I thought Peter Jackson was 'going for' certain things in the LOTR trilogy.

It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good.  I imagine many stories fail the test when there is a male protagonist, especially in truncated media like movies, because you don't have enough time to develop every background element to the same detail.  That would be an active hindrance in surreal works. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead. newlinechar  newlinechar Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.  Most romantic comedies for example are all about sex relations so it may strain a very fair screenplay to change in order to 'pass', unless it was done in a very trivial way that would seem to undermine the point of the test.

Aahh the secret: use a shampoo for dyed hair, wash and rinse in cold water, and most importantly, rinse until the water is COMPLETELY clear. If the rinse water is still tinted, that means there is still loose pigment, and that will readily contaminate your other colours. Once out out the shower, immediately squeeze as much water as you can out, then wrap it in a towel, then swap for another towel after a few minutes, then maybe a third. Drying it faster means less time for further loose pigment to transfer. This will also prevent you from staining your pillow cases and shirt collars!

That may temper the reality a bit, but if that was the point of the review then it is either poorly written or maliciously edited.  Reviews are notoriously bad in terms of having some useful criticism mixed in with a lot of useless comments to which the authors are expected to respond with a counter comment.  You get a lot of reviewers having a biased view of the work or trying to get their work cited in the paper.  That is just how things work.  But if the excerpted comments are representative, then the reviewer either failed to make their point or clearly crossed the line into flat out sexism.

It's very easy to show that Christianity makes no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar The narrative is that God required the death of an innocent person before he'd forgive everyone. Why? What use does a god have with a corpse? Okay, so we killed someone. Now sins are forgiven? How do those two things logically follow? Why does seeing a heart stop beating satiate god? newlinechar  newlinechar And if it's a just god, how does it make sense that he'd demand an innocent person get punished for shit he didn't do? Punishing an innocent person is pretty much the *opposite* of justice. newlinechar  newlinechar Some say, 'Jesus volunteered for it.' Okay, so what? It still doesn't make sense that God required it in the first place. Secondly, if somebody murdered your family and got away never to be caught, and your innocent neighbor said, 'since you want justice done, I will volunteer to go to prison in the killer's place,' would you accept that and call it justice? Of course not, that makes no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar Some say, 'you're right, it's not justice. It's God's grace that he forgives us.' If that's the case, then why did there need to be a sacrifice, if it's not for justice's sake? newlinechar  newlinechar Some say, 'death is the debt owed for sin, it's like god paying off our mortgage.' In this scenario, god would be the one the mortgage is owed *to,* in which case he could just waive it. If somebody owes you money, and you want to forgive the debt, you just waive it, you don't need to go through the actions of driving to your bank, withdrawing the money, driving around the block and going back into the bank and depositing it back in, and say, 'there, I paid your debt to me off.' That makes no sense to go through those motions when the end result is the same. So why would God have to go through the motions of having himself killed in order to pay himself the debt owed to him by other people? And there's still the above problem about what use God has with death anyway - why is that a form of payment he requires/accepts? newlinechar  newlinechar Add in the fact that the person sacrificed was a human avatar of God himself, so it's essentially god sending himself to earth to sacrifice himself to himself, and that the 'sacrifice' was more looks a three-day coma... The entire thing just makes no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar Even in /r/debatereligion, /r/Christianity, and /r/debateachristian, they can't make any sense of it, the answers are generally, 'that's just how it is, death was needed, end of story.' They just sweep something like that that makes no sense under the rug and chalk it up to God's mysteriousness like that. Somebody saying to trust that their story makes sense despite not being able to make sense of it is the hallmark of a scam. newlinechar  newlinechar Go ahead, post this in there. They won't give you any answers that actually make sense of it. I guarantee, 'That's just how it is, it's beyond our understanding' will be the essence of whatever answers they give you.

Sorry, you have to pay for food, because food costs to produce and transport. Same with pads and tampons. Besides, you get what you pay for. I gladly pay a little extra for a good quality brand rather then go for the cheapest economy range store ones, because they work better, are more reliable and are more comfortable. God knows what sort of thing you could expect for free.

Isn't it appropriate to apply it to hominoidea though? Reptile, I understand, is one that doesn't work biologically anymore since we've been able to sequence DNA and determine relation/ancestry.

Dust and ashes. That was what they had left behind. newlinechar  newlinechar The Republic fleet had come fresh from battle. Over the fifth moon of Malachor the Mandalorian fleets and armies that had invaded the Republic had been put to battle, and destroyed. Destroyed at great cost, and with great brutality. Malachor was ash - less than ash, it was ruin, and the ruin of the moon echoed and screamed with the dark side of the Force, as the bones of the very earth were rent by a great weapon. newlinechar  newlinechar No rest, then, for the Republic victors. No triumph or parade across the Core Worlds. Straight from Malachor they had jumped, led by an instinct in the Force, out of the known galaxy into the peril of the Unknown Regions.  newlinechar  newlinechar On the bridge of the Interdictor-class battle cruiser stood Revan, the Jedi commander and saviour of the Republic. It was he who had spurred the fightback against the terrible might of the Mandalorian clans, defying a Jedi council who, wary of the currents of the Force, had ordered caution.  newlinechar  newlinechar On the bridge of the battle cruiser stood Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith. So he had become. For in the horrors of the Mandalorian Wars all Jedi had learned two truths, forgotten in the long years of peace since the Freedon Nadd uprising. The first was brutally simple: suffering is the only constant in the galaxy. The heart of the Force might be life, but to live, to exist, meant to sacrifice. The second was even simpler: from emotions come strength.  newlinechar  newlinechar It was on sacrifice, not power, that Revan dwelt as his fleet exited hyperspace, a shadow alone in the light. He had sacrificed soldiers on Cathar, and on Dxun over Onderon, and finally, terribly, at the ruin of Malachor. All this he had done so the Republic could be made safe.  newlinechar  newlinechar He had sacrificed his innocence, too, when he took up the way of the Sith. For the power of the dark side had him trapped in a corner. He had needed transcendent might to beat back the Mandalorians, and prescient Force-led visions had led him to see that he would need still more to face what was ahead. So he had chosen the way of the Sith - with the sole mitigation that the darkness would fall slower for that he had begun it thus - with pity.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Looks like this is it, sir,' came the report from the ship's CO, Captian Koray newlinechar  newlinechar On the main battle display the image appeared as Koray continued his report.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Medium-sized orbital station, shaped like an inward-facing ring. Self-contained atmosphere, and it's edge-on to the main planet - probably doesn't have too much to do with it.' Koray paused to check his sensors. 'Probes are on the way down now, but preliminary scans indicate a power source of tremendous capacity, far more than what you'd need for a station ten times the size - perhaps that's what you, uh, felt, sir.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Koray's service hadn't allayed his obvious scepticism in the more mystic aspects of the Force, but Revan let it slide - he was an excellent officer, after all. And the ring - newlinechar  newlinechar The ring filled him with fear.  newlinechar  newlinechar There was no reason why an obscure space station that wasn't answering hails should strike fear into a seasoned commander, especially one who was fresh from winning the galaxy's latest war, but there it was. It also didn't help that as he stretched out his perception, trying to touch the minds on the station, he felt nothing but a yawning, terrible hunger. No more.  newlinechar  newlinechar Whatever was on the ring was less than sentient, but more than beast. And it was hungry. Revan turned to the captain. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Relay my order to the fleet to form up on the ring, captain. Analyse weak spots and prepare to fire.' newlinechar  newlinechar -will continue tomorrow.

When a player is on the DL they don't take up a roster spot ( 25 on MLB roster). They had to option Montero to the minors to be under the 25 man limit after his start but instead landed on the DL.

Maybe it's just me, but if anything, I've learned to respect *greatly* people who are talented in other skills besides the hard sciences and math.

My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI.  It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into it (doctors, insurance, diet pushers).  In the same way, the Bechdel test is a simple way of looking at movies that in the aggregate but is too simple to draw any solid conclusions.  Such as: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;demonstrates inequality against women. newlinechar  newlinechar From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.  Maybe an MRA would hold a stronger objection to the premise of the test, but I don't have any issue with it as originally formulated.  I think it can point out a way that we can change the film industry, but not really say much about the level of inequality unless you define inequality as failing the Bechdel test.

What I have learned during my time with two Radeon 7850s in Crossfire is that it isn't worth the bother.  I don't think I have played a single new release title without some sort of massaging necessary to get gains out of Crossfire.  Even in some mature titles, like Skyrim, it massively screws it up and you need to go hunting through forums to find a profile that might fix the issue (Assassin Creed: Brotherhood profile worked for Skyrim).  I wish I had just sold the 7850 at upgrade time and bought a better single card.

Brumbek handled himself very poorly here. He steered the conversation towards talking about harassment to the point it devolved into it being the spotlight after the hour mark. Good job on TB's part for at least trying to moderate it early on by saying this was irrelevant to the topic at hand and calling out Polygon for invoking the same method for their article's headline, but the SMIM author definitely led everyone by the nose. Very disappointed that they missed out on discussing the 25%-75% split because of this. newlinechar  newlinechar First, you don't get to categorize all modders as either being neutral or fully supportive of this plan. Acting as if it was only the players that were complaining about having paid mods was disingenuous and only served to help the next point. newlinechar  newlinechar Do not start labeling people as 'not part of the community' because of criteria #1, #2, #3, etc. There was a lot of 'external activity', as you call it, because this was an issue that would have far reaching ramifications on the gaming industry. As Robin brought up, the backlash was inevitable given the current climate of paid content acting as a crutch for the base game and how easily it could be exploited by publishers and development companies. newlinechar  newlinechar The attitude towards these peoples' opinions was disgusting, Brumbek. Calling people 'terrorists' is a good way of alienating someone who may have been on your side to begin with. Weigh the merits of the points people bring up before knocking them down without consideration. If you let extremists color your perception of an argument, then yes, this same backlash will happen again because more and more people will become fed up having not been listened to. newlinechar  newlinechar There was also a lot of flip-flopping on Brumbek's part throughout the interview, mostly in regards to Valve, along with a lot of fake humbleness, though I'll just chalk it up to natural artist pride.

Better—it's a news source. People are such in arms about California tribes, I would never trust a blog; not that I really trust the newspapers that might either. newlinechar  newlinechar Link to the original article in the Sacramento Bee doesn't work. [Here](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article19563546.html) it is. The Sac Bee calls them 'Modoc,' although apparently they are [Achomawi](http://library.sdsu.edu/guides/sub2.php?id=195&amp;pg=193). The press always seems to take issue with how incredibly small California tribes are, while ignored the history that made them so small. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; '$1.1 million it receives in revenue sharing from the state’s big casino tribes, and several hundred thousand dollars in federal funds earmarked for tribal governments.' —from *Sacramento Bee* newlinechar  newlinechar That's cool! I had no idea that California tribes share revenue amongst themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Howard Dickstein, one of the nation’s foremost tribal lawyers, said the adoption of people with no connection to the tribe and little or no Indian blood “doesn’t pass the smell test.” newlinechar  newlinechar I agree, but it's a more than a little ironic after the uproar about the Cherokee Freedmen, Muscogee Creek Freedmen, and Seminole Freedmen. A non-Indian would still not have a CDIB card, so wouldn't be eligible for services outside the tribes (i.e. they couldn't go to IHS). I wonder if the Comanches let Johnny Depp vote in tribal elections? newlinechar  newlinechar It doesn't sound like they will be able to build a casino off the rancheria lands no matter who they adopt. It still wouldn't be tribal trust lands. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; “The courts have held that tribal disputes are internal to the tribe, and only tribes have the authority to resolve them, so basically we’re told to keep hands off,” Risling said. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, tell that to the Seminoles, Muscogee Creeks, and Cherokees. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; he claimed traces of Cherokee, Apache and Lumbee Indian blood. newlinechar  newlinechar I love these wild combinations! Apaches were imprisoned in Florida in the late 19th century and some really did end up in Louisiana, but wonder how the Apache made it out to North Carolina. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope they straighten it all out. Tribes do lose recognition. newlinechar

The Bechdel test is a single litmus test. It's not suppose to comment on the whole value of a film.  It's just a broad measure of temperature of equality. (Like how carbon dating can't tell you if something is 100 years old... but it can tell you that something is 10000 years old). newlinechar  newlinechar It's also a low bar measure ('The film can't even pass this basic test') newlinechar  newlinechar And, Legally blonde is kind of a bad example because it's pretty much a feminist film in disguise of a romantic comedy. (I'm willing to explain my reasoning)  Although the musical is better.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

It will remain in its _chosen_ _orbit_. Period. Not stationary with respect to a mass. newlinechar  newlinechar Whenever it's not taken up it exercises significant discretion. It would probably avoid falling into a sun. When it was holding Loki to The Bifrost it still let him breathe but it didn't let him slink out from under it. When it was on the deck-plate of the helicarrier, even while denying the Hulk, it didn't exert any appreciable forces on the carrier itself. If it didn't have these traits Thor would have to clutch it to his chest whenever he showered or took to the restroom while at sea or on the carrier etc. newlinechar  newlinechar I could conceivably pick it up and move it with its consent even while being denied the ability to 'wield' it. Such largess would be rare indeed, but not against the spirit nor the letter of the rules. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance if it was left somewhere that would prevent an ambulance full of bleeding orphans from reaching help, and I were the ambulance driver, and my sole motive was to move the hammer so that I can get the orphans to safety, that motive might make me 'worthy enough' to drag it a few feet, but not so much worthy enough to call lightning and smite foes. newlinechar

Yes, I have :)  I take measurements every few months, especially before I go bra shopping. My most recent measurements are 40' 37' 47' 49' 46' and the calculator came up with 38GG, but I believe I was overestimated by a few cup sizes, assuming that a Cacique 38F is equivalent to a UK 38F. The next cup size up in Cacique is a G, and that's too big for me. I forgot to add in the post that I was confident in my size, and I really want to know how it would translate to the different brands that people on this sub wear. Like if a brand runs smaller or bigger in the cups than what I'm used to, or if it is meant for narrow or wide roots. I just don't want to order something that doesn't fit or is the wrong shape.

I typically refer to human beings as apes, personally, but the definition used by society at large (including the scientifically literate public who accept evolution) only includes non-human hominoids.

It does that one thing correct. It is designed to measure the accuracy of your circle based on the requirement of there being 3 points. It does not take into account discontinuous points, solid objects, etc., all of which would make it much more complex and involve it doing lots of other things correctly as well.

Not me. Unlike Adnan, I know where I was on January 13, 1999 and if pressed, I could prove it, particularly six weeks after that date. But, if given time I'd be able to prove it now. In all seriousness, when you take a closer look at how many people were in close proximity to Woodlawn High School between 2:15 and 3-4 pm and would be in a  position to gain entry into Hae's car, it's not so hard to narrow things down quite a bit.

Overall its quite good but there's some stuff I take exception to:  newlinechar  newlinechar Tank and infantry CV is likely more optimal, you don't need 9 cvs.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tank cvs will still die to cluster artillery like the smerch readily, infantry will not.  newlinechar  newlinechar Top armor only matters for cluster weapons and LGBs. (this was a little unclear) all other AOE weapons will hit side/front/rear armor.  newlinechar  newlinechar 1 armor takes full HE damage from shells and bombs, 2 takes .4 so a 2 av all around unit is quite resistant to blind artillery.  newlinechar  newlinechar Helicopters can arrive at the front and return refuels far faster than trucks, so in tandem with an fob are a much superior option.  newlinechar  newlinechar When only allowed five cards of infantry in an untyped deck to say you should always take MANPADS is flat out wrong. (you mention this later) newlinechar  newlinechar No mention of vehicle fodder, no mention of CEV. I am dissapointed.  newlinechar  newlinechar No mention that the super cobra has only a 50% chance of killing one helicopter for 115 pts.  newlinechar  newlinechar No mention that the DAP is second only to the TY-90  newlinechar  newlinechar Your comments about SEAD missiles are false.  newlinechar  newlinechar Turning off the radar after the missile has been launched will cause the missile to impact the last known location of the radar unit.  newlinechar  newlinechar Usually this overlaps with the current location of the radar unit, but if fast moving or wheeled it can in fact escape in time.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not much mention of superheavy combat, or town and forest combat.

As a big Green Party supporter I'm going with Bernie this election. Bernie has been an independent for awhile and shares a lot of Green values. But he's running as a Democrat so as not to be a spoiler. I think this is our only real chance of getting a Green-like president. Of course in a perfect world we wouldn't be locked into the two party system but I know so Bernie people afraid to vote third party so as not to 'throw away their vote'. I really think Bernie is the best compromise of this. He's a far left Green-like candidate throwing in with the Democrats so as to actually have a chance. I can respect that and will support him the whole way. newlinechar  newlinechar Read his website so as to see what he stands for. https://berniesanders.com/issues/ newlinechar  newlinechar He's also the only real chance at beating Hillary too. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Fixed Barry/Bernie autocorrect.
What I find interesting is that you give the link to the correct (or at least officially accepted) study, and even a cursory look shows that we are far from the ~200K sexual assaults on inmates that the Daily Mail claims exist. The document states that the number of inmates claiming they were sexually assaulted rose from ~6,000 (2005) to ~9,000 (2011). However, the report also states that the confirmed/verified assaults have stayed stable over the years (from 885 to 902).  newlinechar  newlinechar Even if we assume that all alleged sexual assaults did indeed occur, the Daily Mail's figures are ~20 times over the official ones.

Not everyone who dies is 'executed', some people, especially long term drug abusers live their lives one foot in the grave and it doesn't take much to tip them in. There was this friend of my wife's family who was arrested years ago. He fought and was restrained laying flat on his gut. Years of drinking and smoking exotic weeds had left his lungs far less than totally efficient and he suffered fairly catastrophic brain damage as a result. The cops fault? I don't think so. Seems like I heard that he recently died. Not because of the actions of the police, it was a result of his own actions combined with his chosen lifestyle.

Sorry, what I meant was, the platypuses alive today never evolved.  Their genetic counterparts split off from them and became new species, but the platypus alive today have been the same for millions of years.  The environment those particular platypus are in was perfect for them, and they thrived there without having to change.

Am I the only one who finds posts like this one to be a bit silly? We all know this isn't *typical* behavior for a 3 year old. Claiming this as a reason for not wanting children is nothing like saying you don't want kids because they cost a fortune, constantly shit themselves and generally drain the life from their parents. newlinechar  newlinechar If someone were to say that they don't want dogs and referred to one of any number of the vicious dog attacks that occur every day as their reasoning, I suspect that a few of us here (myself included) would see a problem with that logic. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess I just don't see the point in posts like these, other than to say 'See!? Look! Kids are **evil!**'. But kids aren't generally evil, and so this isn't a good reason to be child-free, IMO.

 I trust that film makers (especially high-budget features) won't waste money on films that aren't going to be watched by as many people as possible. They're very good at it by now. I can't imagine that they *don't* cater to the market as attitudes change over the years. I suppose it could be argued they're almost the perfect cultural barometer.  newlinechar If films are male-centric, then only a tiny majority of people seem to care, and they're not going to make any changes to the film industry.

My friend back on the Xbox bought a $20 shark card. He spent it all on cars, then kept selling the cars. He eventually lost all of his money because he couldn't decide on a car.

Since there is no evidence, none at all, that Adnan strangled her and threw her in a ditch, just your (and others) 'gut feelings,' I'm always puzzled by people who make the argument that he did it, end of story.  On some level, it feels like (yes, I'm going to say it) racism. It's not intentional, just good old fashioned institutional racism on a subconscious level.  It happens -- Adnan is brown and Muslim and there is a lot of Islamophobia going around these days.

I highly recommend you do a quick search for the few posts by men complaining about their wives' bodies post-pregnancy and notice 2 things: 1, that they are *very* few and far between. Do you really think so little of your husband that he didn't prepare for this when he married you? 2, these men get absolutely scathing responses from pretty much everyone. There is no support for guys who complain about the body change their wives endure for birthing the child they sired.

Well, that's why most IT certs now you just pay the yearly maint fee and keep up on continuing ed.

Although regular Danes easily change opinions concerning the EU, they are also massively uninformed and quick to focus on negative sides while ignoring that 50%-66% of our laws (which work great) can be traced directly back to the EU. It does feel a bit utopian to imagine the population and our politicians suddenly becoming massively pro-Europe and maybe even federalist. I'll keep a packed suitcase under my bed in case it gets relevant.

Sorry, don't know what you're talking about. Her win on the Conjoined Twins episode, which just happened one episode ago, was in no way controversial. It clearly was between her team and Katya's.

In fact, a # of the wins have felt a bit arbitrary but I don't see how Pearl's were any less deserved than the ones I've mentioned.

Turns out crucifixions and Christianity both rose from ancient human sacrifices intended to enbue the wood with protective energies. Jesus was a great witch who linked with a full coven and sacrificed himself, granting protective powers to the essence of the cross rather than just one. Witches then created Christianity to convince people to wear the protective charms long after they had forgotten about the vampire monsters the crosses were created to protect us from.

I know you've answered the previous question a few times, but never really elaborate.  What's involved in being a 'head ice tech'?

I could find more specific examples if you'd like, but the first one someone would notice would be the first track on the album, 'Treat Her Like a Prostitute'. It sounds like Rick may have had some heartbreak, but that doesn't make treating every woman like a prostitute acceptable. newlinechar  newlinechar I could definitely see how, this album being your intro to rap, you would have a soft spot for it, and it would stick in your memory pretty easily. It's not as if I hate the album, and I have a lot of respect for Rick and what he did for hip-hop. I just disagree with a lot of the content. As for why the sound doesn't stick out to me as one of the best is probably  because a lot of rappers that came after him emulated a lot of what he did, and that sound eventually split into a lot of different sounds, each of which may still be being perfected today. Not many people read Shakespeare on the daily for fun, but he's present in all modern literature, just like Rick and other early hip-hop pioneers are found in all modern hip-hop. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for the reply, and by the way, good guide! Could use some expanding, but it'd definitely help out a Slick Rick newbie.

You're being willfully ignorant here. You can be against Apple products all you like, but saying they did nothing innovative with smartphones or tablets is just beyond ignorant. I don't know if you ever used a pre-iphone smartphone, but I used to. Windows mobile 2003 was god awful. It was such a nightmare to use, the interface was terrible, it required a stylus to use, and calling the browser on it a web browser was really a stretch. Unless you needed one for your job, there was no compelling reason to own one. It couldn't really do anything useful. newlinechar  newlinechar They did the same thing to the tablet market in 2010. You can't be honest with yourself and find a pre-2010 tablet that you'd actually want to own. They were heavy, clunky things with terrible interfaces and very little 3rd party app support. A 2010 iPad is still usable today. newlinechar  newlinechar The iPhone was the first smartphone that people actually wanted. It was easy to use, it was fast, the interface was clean and smooth, it was stable, and you could actually browse the web, the REAL web on it. When the app store was released a few years later, it created a completely new market from scratch overnight. Mobile development is a massive industry now, and it's basically all because of the iPhone. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm an android user, but even I realize that if the iPhone didn't exist, android and smartphones in general wouldn't exist in their current state either. Mobile OSes would certainly be better than win mobile 2003 was, but I highly doubt they'd resemble anything that looks like they do now.

Dunleavy was told to foul IIRC, so w/out context it looks awful.  I still think it's dirty, but i think he really just botched the intentional foul newlinechar  newlinechar Okay so since people on this sub just downvote passionately here is a quote: newlinechar  newlinechar “I felt bad. (Joakim Noah) went down and it looked like he got hit pretty hard, so I was going to take an intentional foul. Lillard went up to shoot and it was one of those things where I got put in an awkward situation. newlinechar  newlinechar “He was in a shooting motion and at that point, I had to foul him hard because I didn’t want to give up a four-point play. It was just an awkward moment. I was going to take the foul but he was shooting a three, so I just went right through him because I wanted to foul but I didn’t want to give up four points on it. newlinechar  newlinechar “It was sort of helpless on my part. I was going to intentionally foul him because of Jo being on the floor. But he went up to shoot and at that point, what do you do? I’m not going to go for his legs or head. I just kind of go through his body, didn’t want him to make a three. Nice kid. I got nothing against him. It was totally unintentional in terms of trying to hurt or injure somebody. I was just trying to intentionally foul him because Jo was lying in the paint.” newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously this doesn't exempt it from being a cheap play or make it right, but I don't think it was malicious.
The riots have made clear that there is a lot of rage and a lack of hope among many people in Baltimore.  And I think a lot of the 'irrationality' of the riots can be chalked down to a combination of a need to blow up against the socio-economic conditions in general and the lack of a real alternative vision for how political economy should be organized.  I think [Slavoj Zizek puts it well in this essay about the 2011 London Riots](http://www.lrb.co.uk/2011/08/19/slavoj-zizek/shoplifters-of-the-world-unite): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The protesters, though underprivileged and de facto socially excluded, weren’t living on the edge of starvation. People in much worse material straits, let alone conditions of physical and ideological oppression, have been able to organise themselves into political forces with clear agendas. The fact that the rioters have no programme is therefore itself a fact to be interpreted: it tells us a great deal about our ideological-political predicament and about the kind of society we inhabit, a society which celebrates choice but in which the only available alternative to enforced democratic consensus is a blind acting out. Opposition to the system can no longer articulate itself in the form of a realistic alternative, or even as a utopian project, but can only take the shape of a meaningless outburst. What is the point of our celebrated freedom of choice when the only choice is between playing by the rules and (self-)destructive violence? newlinechar  newlinechar This has limited application to the Baltimore protests and riots, but I think there are still noteworthy points here. newlinechar  newlinechar I am hoping that some real organizations, rooted in the people most disaffected, will emerge out of Baltimore in the aftermath of the unrest.  Demonstrating rage is not enough; it must be organized and channeled in an effective and efficient manner.  In the '60s, groups like the Revolutionary Action Movement and the Black Panther Party and the League of Revolutionary Workers emerged out of the extremely violent cycles of riots in '67 and '68, and linked up with other oppressed minorities to push for militant and radical change.   newlinechar  newlinechar Hopefully we'll see similar things happen now.  Then, instead of seeing random looting and racialized attacks, we'll see methodological and strategic attacks on targets that make sense--like [how these Mexican militants attacked a state building recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq1SdDCYEA0).

I'm not the previous commenter, but I'll give it a shot.  Presumably, these ancient Jewish judicial codes (if they had any validity) were ordered by God.  I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now? newlinechar  newlinechar As for 'Hate the sin. Love the sinner', it's like saying 'I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.'  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.  Even if hatred of gays wasn't the intent, these statements still encourage it.

Does SHE want a larger diamond though? This is something you need to ask her. I was really clear with my now husband (then fiance) that I did NOT want a big ring.

What if I dropped it? What if I got mugged? I would probably have only worn it for special occasions. Plus, I have tiny fingers (wear a 3.25 size ring) so a larger diamond would have not really been the look that I was going for. I got a cool custom ring with a 0.5 carat flawless diamond and am much happier about it. On the other hand, if she likes big diamonds, then you have to decide whether you want to go for it or not.

Novelty is endlessly pursued, and I think that in itself is a fantasy in dire need of deconstruction.  It's the one thing I dislike about the game, Chalice Dungeons.

While me being a nutritionist i have learned that the body does not want to store fat. Storing excess calories as fat actually takes another step making the body spend energy to turn the excess calories into fat. And a big reason as to why people gain the weight back is because they set goals and when they achieve the goals they go back to their old normal eating habits, forgetting about the diet.

Yes. Most cakes are fine to bake beforehand. Generally, if you are going to add frosting, ganache, fruit, or anything else moist, you want to wait as long as possible on those and do assembly as close to when you serve it as possible. After you bake the cake, turn it out on a rack and let it cool COMPLETELY. Then wrap tightly in a couple layers of plastic wrap. I live in an arid climate, so I generally leave cakes on the counter unless it's a very moist recipe. If you are in a more humid or hot place, you probably want to put it in the fridge. The things you have to worry about are the cake drying out, or the opposite of getting moldy (again usually only an issue with high moisture content).

It was so fast I wasn't entirely sure it was in.  The commentators on HNIC barely reacted and seemed unsure whether it was a goal and on top of that there was very little reaction from the crowd. newlinechar  newlinechar Was kinda weird.
 newlinechar 'Thanks to those two,' I say, pulling on the cockpit doornob. 'The Captain has managed to lock his door, and probably radio that the plane's been attacked. Not how I wanted this to go, but thankfully, our employers are excellent at thinking ahead.' I brandish the crowbar, jamming it into the crack between the door and the wall, and crank the door right off of its hinges. It falls with a satisfying *thump*, which is followed by a very unsatisfying *BANG BANG BANG*  from the copilot firing a gun through the doorway. The first bullet stings at it goes into and out of my left arm, but the other two whiz down the corridor, one hitting Robin 2 in the shoulder and the other hitting some poor middle-aged businessman in the chest.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Shit,' I hear the copilot say. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Yeah,' I reply, laughing. 'Shit.' I rip tear off my suit jacket and rip off the arm of my collared shirt, quickly tying it around my wound. I point my gun around the corner and fire three shots into the cabin, but no cries of pain tell me that I didn't get lucky. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Hey there Cap,' I shout back. 'Your copilot there just killed a passenger. Technically, he's very nearly in just as much trouble as we are now.' I motion to Steam towards the fighter extinguisher mounted on the wall behind him. He grabs it, getting ready for my signal.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'So, here's the thing. This has all pretty much gone to shit. So I'm gonna offer you a deal. Either you can fly us real nicely to Cuba and do what we tell you, or more people,'  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Namely, you,' Steam adds in. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Namely, you,' I confirm. 'Will die.' There's silence in the cabin for a moment. Finally, I hear the Captain say in his gruff voice, 'Fuck you.'  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Ah, we get that a lot,' I say giving Steam the signal. He rolls the extinguisher into the cabin and I leap around the corner, firing two shots. The first misses, but the second his the extinguisher, causing it to explode into white vapor. The copilot fires more bullets wildly into the foam, but I've rolled out of the way back under cover. The plane cabin fills with screams as people duck away from the center of the airplane. Finally, after ten more shots I finally hear a, *click click click*, 'Fuck.' Steam and I rush the cabin. The copilot is trying to reload his pistol. He slams the magazine in and clicks the slide release, but I walk smoothly by him and fire a round into his skull and he slumps forward in his chair. Then I turn to the captain. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Oh captain, my captain,' i say, leaning down next to him. He looks at me, his eyes full of fear. 'Cuba.' He looks down, looking defeated and I see him switch several knobs and switches, and he banks a hard right turn. I smile. Then suddenly he looks back up at me, locking eyes. newlinechar  newlinechar 'No.' And he thrusts the controls forward, dropping the plane into a nosedive. I'm thrown towards the back of the cabin, slamming against the back wall. Steam falls through the open corridor into the passenger cabin. I try to peel myself off the wall, but we're still gaining momentum. I can see the Captain. He has a crazy look in his eye. I raise my pistol and pull the trigger as rapidly as I can. Three bullets hit the control panel, and finally one goes through his seat and, I can only assume, his heart. He lets out a groan, and then slumps forward, his grip on the wheel released. The plane starts to level out. I climb forward, unbuckling the captain and chucking him out of the seat. I climb into the captain's seat myself, strapping in and pulling the plane level. Robin 1 manages to climb into the cabin, looking frazzled.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK WAS THAT!?' He yells. I turn my gun towards him and pull the trigger, but it only clicks. I groan, and just throw it at him. It hits him in the chest. Steam's climbed his way back up also, followed by Robin 2.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Want me to shoot him?' he asks. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Nah, its fine.' Robin 1 looks at us incredulously.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'What is *wrong* with you people?' he shouts.  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Isn't it obvious?' I say, looking him straight in the eye. 'We're professionals.' I turn back to fly the plane, my leg moving up and down restlessly.

This: newlinechar  newlinechar       i= str.find_first_of('*', i) newlinechar  newlinechar finds the first position of an asterisk in the string starting at offset in the string of `i`.  newlinechar  newlinechar This: newlinechar  newlinechar       string::npos newlinechar  newlinechar is a special value that indicates that character(s) that find_first_of was searching for cannot be found. newlinechar  newlinechar So this: newlinechar  newlinechar       while (string::npos != (i= str.find_first_of('*', i))) newlinechar  newlinechar says loop as long as an asterisk can be found. newlinechar  newlinechar Note that to be portable (or even to work), this: newlinechar  newlinechar       int i = 0; newlinechar  newlinechar should really be: newlinechar  newlinechar       std::string::size_type i = 0; newlinechar  newlinechar

But they're still not that great - and they're more expensive! And you have to go and find one after you've done your grocery shopping (and it's America, so you'll probably have to fucking drive to it). Yes, I CAN go to a bakery to buy good bread - but it's a pain that I have to, when I'm used to getting it at the supermarket with everything else. Even the shittiest, cheapest, store-bought, supermarket value bread is much better quality than good quality supermarket bread in the US. We're not trying to be snobby about it, it's just true. Your bread tastes like air.

I can't really argue with the Rockets' decision to fire him from a PR standpoint, but I thought it was a bit harsh. I thought a suspension without pay would've been more appropriate, but that might just be because I personally wasn't offended at all by the joke. newlinechar  newlinechar I just hate when the moral police always comes in and thinks one mistake automatically makes a person scum of the world. Most of the people who are cracking jokes about this guy losing his job aren't doing it because they believe he deserves it, but because they can get their e-fame whether it be RTs/Favs, Karma, or whatever else.

What if she wanted to have the kid?  I'm not saying the kid was planned, especially not that early, but why should the kid have to live away from his mother because she wants to 'find herself'?  She can do all of that at any time. Having a kid isn't the end of your life like many people are so inclined to believe. Just because she had a kid that early doesn't stop her from being who she wants to be.   newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I said good for her is because she stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for her actions. She didn't just abort it or give it off to whatever family would take it.

Eh I can see where she's coming from, to be honest. Neither she nor 95% of the Inquisition know Dorian personally, all they know is he's a mage from a generally hostile realm, a realm once ruled in part by the very enemy the Inquistion is fighting against, a realm where the cult that supports said enemy currently has a notable amount of political power... and he's managed to gain the confidence of possibly the most (currently) important person in Thedas. newlinechar  newlinechar She hasn't spoken to Dorian the way the Inquisitor has, doesn't know he's thoroughly opposed to everything that makes the Imperium 'the bad guys' - and frankly he doesn't really seem all that interested in telling her, either. The only interaction we actually see between them is antagonistic both ways. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, she has every right to be concerned, in my opinion.

This is why I have started taking 5-6 pics of every phone I am sending in. I regret not doing it with my first phones I sent them, because it will be tough to prove they were in good shape without pics.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I have had a similar experience with 2 phones so far. They had stated both were appraised at their full value, then I received a $13 gc for one and a $38 gc for another. I will be calling them tomorrow to give them a piece of my mind. Especially since Christopher never called me back today. I plan to specifically ask for him, call him out on his lies, then ask for his supervisor.

Really though? Carr had no weapons last year and the Raiders were the worst offense in the league.

Williams gives them youth to pair with Mack, Cooper gives them youth to pair with Carr.

Just curious, since you are on this forum (so I assume you like Hip-Hop) and you're clearly pretty far from the Men's Rights dipshits on Reddit, how do you consume Hip-Hop? This genre is riddled with misogyny to the point where it's part of Hip-Hop's identity. If the sexism isn't explicit objectification like Slick Rick, it's often implicit (male gaze, male mc's being favored etc.). Do you draw a line somewhere? because if Slick Rick bothers you, I assume Rick Ross, Project Pat, Juicy J, Cam'ron, Dr. Dre, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, and plenty of others probably bother you in some ways too. Just wondering since I support/sympathize with the women's rights movement, but I also still listen to R. Kelly (who is by all accounts a terrible person) because I feel like I can separate them in my head.

Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities. newlinechar  newlinechar Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement. newlinechar  newlinechar We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U. newlinechar  newlinechar Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war. newlinechar  newlinechar Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve.

If looks are the only thing you are worried about you have made it the most important thing. I don't think you need to be punished for not having to worry about child care costs or insurance either but when the economics and other real life logistics are taken care of it lets us worry about other things. You are choosing to worry about this particular topic. I think for example because I am a pediatric nurse and I know the multitude of unplanned things that can happen in childhood I would worry about other things and that is driven by the particular slice of live I spend a lot of time in. It is natural because you are a 10/10 as described by your husband you focus on looks. We react to the particular things that shape our direct experience.

Oh, you'll face humiliation and taunting for being vegan, but believe me it isn't quite the same as being gay.

I don't think this is the case. As far as I know, only J'zargo levels up with the player. I have read that transforming a follower into an animal with the Wabbajack resets their level to that of the player, but I have never bothered to verify this myself. newlinechar  newlinechar I do think that followers are set to a level when you first meet them. Take for example Borgakh the Steel Heart, a female Orc that can be your follower, who lives in [Mor Khazgur.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mor_Khazgur) newlinechar  newlinechar Her level is set to the player's level, up to a maximum of level 30. Her armor is always Heavy Armor, but depends on the player's level. If you meet her at level 30 or higher, she'll be wearing Orcish Armor. At lower levels it will be steel if I remember correctly. newlinechar  newlinechar So if you have a favorite follower in mind it might be best to look up their maximum level and wait until you hit that before you meet them. That way they'll be at maximum strength.

It depends how closely you want to stick to the established law/forgotten realms setting. If you are ok modifying the law or making your own which i would recommend then you will be fine. newlinechar  newlinechar You could use the tiefling race for him and say that, that while originally human he sold his soul to &gt;insert demon/devil lord here&lt; for &gt;insert motivation/reason here&lt; you could also make him a warlock due to him getting powers from this entity. As time drew by and he used these powers more and more he slowly became corrupted. First his skin began to gain a reddish tinge a little at a time, the stubs of horns began to push through the crown of his head and a tail began to grow. (Ask how he responded to this change when it happened). Eventually he turned into what is known as a teifling (this assumes that teiflings are not common or existant at all in your world). newlinechar  newlinechar For his stats you can build him up as a PC and make him higher level  with magic items and such so that he can stand easily against a party of adventurers. Alternatively if you didnt like the teifling idea you could just use the stats of some of the more powerful/challenging demons and devils in the monster manuel..... just change his weapons and Armour, maybe provide spellcasting and a skin change. newlinechar  newlinechar For his background i love a tragic villain here is a breif one i used in my last campaign.... obviously brief and summarized.  newlinechar  newlinechar Taught magic by mother, Mother executed in silver flame witch hunts. newlinechar Fled and grew up on the streets.

Dorian and his wife where tortured and persecuted, however due to his wife's insistence they never raised a finger to protect themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar When the blight (magical disease thing) swept through the land killing many, she sacrificed herself in order to cast a powerful spell cleansing the blight from the land. Dorian heartbroken told the people of her heroics, instead the people blamed her for the blight. They burnt their small house down and paraded her dead body through the streets only to burn it too along with their newly born daughter.  newlinechar  newlinechar Howling in anguish , Dorian prayed to his wife to forgive him as he unleashed the powerful magics that he had gained, all day he raged killing everybody he could find. They say the smell of smoke and ozone didn’t settle for weeks and you can still feel the heavy mark of death upon the wasteland that was once a great city. Dorian used magics learnt from his warlock master, to make a deal with the devil lord Daegon, in return for helping the devil lord invade the material plane.

I don't see people post a character's worst feats very often. I'm not sure that would help my issue either. That's just cherry picking from the other extreme.

I want to know what *would* happen.  newlinechar  newlinechar I like certain characters a lot, but I don't unequivocally support them.

East Asian concepts of filial piety and absolute respect for authority create a cultural environment that is incredibly hospitable for abusive parents/spouses. There's also the communist revolution/civil war that happened in China/Taiwan and created a generation of emotionally stunted people and paranoia.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then there's also the fact that East Asia was heavily agricultural and the way rice grows means that you need everyone to work together without question. This system leads to low value for individuality, and high value on the needs of the whole group. It also explains why Asian parents are extremely prone to grooming their kids for college a certain way just because everyone else is doing it. There's a consistent formula for farming/weather, the thought pattern carried over to everything else.

Hi nic hru
It was nowhere near Skyrim's level, I think that Skyrim will seriously be like the most modded game ever. Lol. Witcher 1 didn't have too many mods, and Witcher 2 didn't either, but that was because they released the REDkit like 2 years after the game's release. They're releasing the REDkit for Wild Hunt along with the game, so we'll see more mods. But if I honestly had to guess, it would just be graphics mods, or UI mods. It's not the type of game that you can mod like Skyrim, because they're both open world RPGs, but at the same time they're completely different.
I think you might actually have the Greeks and the Persians mixed up this time. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Curiously enough the anticipation of Cyrus, when at the council of war he admonished the Hellenes not to mind the shouting of the Asiatics, was not justified. Instead of shouting, they came on in deep silence, softly and slowly, with even tread. newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar And now the two battle lines were no more than three or four furlongs apart, when the Hellenes began chanting the paean, and at the same time advanced against the enemy. newlinechar  newlinechar But with the forward movement a certain portion of the line curved onwards in advance, with wave-like sinuosity, and the portion left behind quickened to a run; and simultaneously a thrilling cry burst from all lips, like that in honour of the war-god — eleleu! eleleu! and the running became general. Some say they clashed their shields and spears, thereby causing terror to the horses; and before they had got within arrowshot the barbarians swerved and took to flight.'  newlinechar (Book I, Section VIII)  newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's also worth noting that it's entirely possible that the Persians deliberately withdrew and succeeded in separating Cyrus from his best troops: http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/antiq_0770-2817_1992_num_61_1_1135/article_antiq_0770-2817_1992_num_61_1_1135.pdf

Good points! I forgot to mention the horizontal force as one of the potential problems, but it did go through my mind. Luckily, living in coastal BC, I have a huge selection of very strong trees to hang from!

It only takes a minute or so and I have been able to be quite comfortable at a few different hang angles in my GT hammock.

I've seen a few setups that have a tarp ridgeline, hammock suspension with ridgeline, and a bugnet ridgeline and I thought this could be a way to make setup simpler!

On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later. newlinechar  newlinechar But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work. newlinechar  newlinechar I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting. newlinechar  newlinechar I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general. newlinechar  newlinechar At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying.

Honestly, not as much as I used to. I agree, he was (and still is, presumably) a great villain, but with everything else going on this season and with more formidable foes being introduced/reintroduced (Bill, the Shapeshifter, Giffany, Society of the Blind Eye), I kind of feel like Gideon's been shoved to the sidelines, which I find myself strangely okay with. I don't mind that he will return, but I'm not anxiously anticipating it either.

You really dictionary-ceptioned me there so this may not be the best response since I'm on my phone but here goes: newlinechar  newlinechar First you defined the word 'just' using a self-referential description. The definition of just I see on merriam-webster.con says, 'agreeing with what is morally right or good' and 'treating people in a way that is considered morally right.' So by that definition regardless of if they willingly gave their labor for free, I don't think it is just to take advantage of that for profit. newlinechar  newlinechar And what I am suggesting is possible, it is called a workers cooperative. If the entire community (company) has equal say in the direction of the company and they know that they are more competitive working together than separate; wouldn't it logically fit that if they are greedy they will work together to generate more profits as a community? newlinechar  newlinechar As far as generating revenue for expansion it works like any other company, the owners would take less pay in order to pay for the things the company needs. And by owners I mean everyone in the co-op. newlinechar  newlinechar And if you wanted to work for for lower pay than someone else and apply for the same job as someone else my co-op and I would choose the person that fits in best and add them to our list of equal owners.  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, i disagree that democracy is a failure, at least not direct democracy.

I don't think anyone can really even begin to answer that especially without input from Will. His outburst and the extent of his hatred seemingly came from nowhere. There has to be something more to his outburst other than Shirin questioning him. Shirin stated in her RHAP interview that she felt that there was tension between them before the outburst, but when she tried to talk about it with Will he refuted it. In an extra clip she also said she was happy when Will had to leave the survivor Auction. All of this hatred between Will and Shirin is seemingly new to us. Is it possible it had something to do with her identity? Certainly, I just don't think we have a whole lot to go on.

This is pretty much how I've understood it as well -- when there first began a massive influx of American/UK women ordering from EM, there was no real warning around that the bras ran wicked tight, and that you should size up 1-2 bands from your UK size.

I have to say that I've purchased over half the bras she put out in 2014 (I feel guilty admitting that, lol. A good portion of them were re-homed!), and I find most of them to run TTS.

Jay did get burned telling facts that were later contradicted by alibis.

Then whoops, Cathy was interviewed says she saw the call at her place. newlinechar  newlinechar Next interview, call took place at Cathy's. newlinechar  newlinechar Jay had a lot of shots to fire and did in fact miss with a lot of them. newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing to keep in mind is that when Jay is being questioned, he's brought in because the police suspect Adnan.  That context would suggests quite a lot about Adnan's possible alibis to the person being interviewed, at least, that they weren't trivially verifiable because the police are looking into him.

I have to be frank -- this is pretty fucking stupid.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's one thing to go fight as an individual without children, or one that is older and has grown children, but to leave one's young children in such a situation is pretty low. The good she can do in this world through being there for her children is many many times greater than the small contribution she can make to YPG.  newlinechar  newlinechar Before you label me sexist, I'd say the same thing for men in her circumstances. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing that she suffered from some level of ennui/existential despair in the United States and wanted to find a new greater life purpose. Interestingly enough, that ennui is also what often motivates people to embrace Daesh/other jihadi groups. The [of course significant] difference lies in what values are embraced as representing the 'higher purpose.' Fortunately she chose those of PYD.  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: I looked at her facebook. She's with the Peshmerga in Iraq, not YPJ in Syria.

It has been proven, time and time again, that the death penalty does not deter people from crime. newlinechar  newlinechar Execute a criminal and there is one less criminal and no chance of recidivism. Whereas you have millions of people in US jails, which hasn't deterred crime either. Meanwhile they continue to commit crimes and violence against other prisoners while in jail. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think the death penalty is necessary because it deters crime however. I just think it is the right outcome for the worst murderers.  newlinechar  newlinechar We can certainly address the underlying social issues that lead to crime, but I have no problem keeping the death penalty as well.

What I'm saying is that if they wanted folks on their side there are many angles they could've chosen that wouldn't have been 'our jobs are harder, we're superior fuck you' kind of connotation.   newlinechar  newlinechar I personally had an amazing interaction with a cop when I took my friend to the ER to get her rape kit/SANE done. I was so worried the cop was going to somehow shame my friend for the situation. He knew it too, I was preemptively defensive on her behalf (she asked me to stay during the whole thing). He was totally professional, super helpful (I'm about X feet tall and Y pounds, was he taller than me? Bigger/thinner?).   newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly I've worked with some cops while doing pick up orders (taking mentally ill folks to the ER as they are in violation of their court order for treatment) and some of them are amazing.   newlinechar  newlinechar And then there was a time when I was terrified because a cop was working himself up on a power trip and I was scared of what they would do to me.   newlinechar  newlinechar So I get what you're saying, I know there are shitty cops in this state. But I've worked with some decent ones. And I think that what you're saying may be true in some instances but it's not true overall.

I don't know, I never understood why people did that. Every hero's base DPS is based on their cost, but with a penalty based on their 'slot', so every hero has lower base DPS per cost than the previous one due to that penalty. newlinechar  newlinechar Following that logic, you'd be better off using whichever hero will get the closest to 4100 by the time you ascend, with the higher base DPS and higher amount of x4 (and x10) multipliers. newlinechar  newlinechar Now obviously if you're going for a super deep run to 4K+ you're gonna want to use Astraea, but... well, I don't know. I just don't know the math behind it. I'd say regild Astraea if you're going for a very deep run (several days), but if you just want to increase your current highest by a couple hundred, which hero you use probably won't make much of a difference.

Hypergamy is sort of the ultimate self evident truth of TRP. If you can't see hypergamy daily in your life it just means you aren't opening your eyes. Women clearly are looking for the best alpha possible with the highest level combination of looks, money, and status. If hypergamy wasn't real then Justin Bieber wouldn't get the insane reaction he does from women of all ages when he's spotted in a public space. You don't see rabid swarms of men gathering en masse all around the world just to catch a glimpse of a famous attractive woman the way rabid swarms of women of all ages gather for a famous attractive man.

As a member of a sorority, frats and date rape are undoubtedly connected.  Of course not all (or even many) fraternity men are rapists.  Nor are all rapists frat bros.  But will you ever see me drinking the frat's alcohol at one of their parties?  Not a chance.  At my school, they most definitely have spiked their mixed drinks with nyquil before, and they almost always use much higher proof alcohol so they can claim 'a drink only has 2 shots in it'.  Most of the women I know who have been sexually assaulted have had their assailant be a frat bro or someone at one of the fraternity parties.  
Due to the insular nature of the Jewish community, identification of Jewish DNA seems to be fairly reliable.  So you very likely have Jewish heritage.

My older brother committed suicide two months before yours. I've only had two dreams about him; in the first, it was Christmas exactly like when I was a kid. The excitement waking me up at 4am just to look at presents for four hours until my parents woke, the smells, the snow lightly falling. My big brother was standing in front of the Christmas tree with an emerald dress (imagine the Queen's dress in the Silver Chair, BBC version). In the second dream, he had faked his death to get out of student loans and had come back to see me. It was a terrible mixture of fury directed at him for faking suicide and the most incredible relief I have ever felt. I have yet to dream about my little brother's suicide (3/9/14).

Ok, let me try to provide some, but keep in mind that this is based on Quebec law which is different from other provinces... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; An attended child who shoplifts has his parent or guardian charged with the crime, but an unattended child cannot newlinechar  newlinechar I have read a few times in newspapers of underage kids shoplifting with their parent present and the parents being arrested, under the premise that the parents used the kids to steal ('Oh, sorry officer, my kid doesn't know what he was doing'). newlinechar  newlinechar I realized in hindsight that this is a very different context than I had expressed and I was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Parents are generally monetarily responsible for the damage their children cause regardless of if the parent was there at the time or not. He speaks about cases but provides none. newlinechar  newlinechar A few teenagers burned down a high school in Québec and the parents were held not responsible eventually: newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-hopes-to-recoup-16-6m-from-parents-of-young-arsonists-1.845451 newlinechar  newlinechar I do realize the article says the exact opposite of my point, but I can't at this moment find the verdict which, from my memory, proved to be the opposite: the burden wasn't on the parent and they were exonorated. newlinechar  newlinechar My entire quote was based on that memory of that verdict (and quite a few similar ones in recent years in Québec) and it only applies to Québec, I now realize. newlinechar  newlinechar As such, I was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Additionally, he's melded criminal law (being charged by the government for a criminal offense contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada) and civil law into one point. (Civil law is a plaintiff initiating a lawsuit against a parent for the damage their children caused. Depending on the situation it could be a tort like conversion, negligence etc. see for a summary newlinechar  newlinechar You are 100% right. This is a mistake I don't usually do, and as such, I felt a lot more confident in what I was writing than I should have been, since I was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Again, this is completely unsubstantiated and he provides no context. What were the facts of the case. What was the lawsuit initiated around. What he is saying makes no sense in the context he is presenting. He is saying the parents were not liable/held responsible because 'they did their own part in the education of their child' and the child 'proved his maturity' and used that as a defense. But as a defense to what charge or lawsuit?  newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the same lawsuits, the one I cited and a few others, like one where a teenager started a fire in a trashcan near his school which burned part of the school and the parent were rules not responsible for the damages by citing they were good parents. newlinechar  newlinechar But again, this is a civil code law which possibly only exist in Québec. This article was about Calgary and my intervention was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You do not get accused to court. You appear in court as a defendant after you have either been charged with a crime and have been arraigned or you are served with a statement of claim in a civil lawsuit. (this is an oversimplification) newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, an oversimplifcation added to the fact that I don't know all of the legal terms in English, and to the fact that visibly, I didn't have all of my head this morning (not that it's better now). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; He's talking about the prosecution again which designates criminal law. Civil law does not have prosecutors. Civil law has plaintiffs and complainants who initiate a lawsuit. Prosecutors lay charges on an individual. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, thank you... I kept searching for the right names, and settled on prosecutor, but you are right, it''s the plaintiff. newlinechar

There's an argument that part of getting out of debt is about generating momentum. Not only does it give you a good feeling to retire out debts, the more that you close out, the less you need to keep track of as you continue the process. From that standpoint, making a mistake if you end up having a hard time juggling it could cost you more money than what you'd save if you went after the highest interest loan first. I'd close out the smaller ones. You'll feel great when you retire them and get some momentum to go after the last one.

I'm afraid I'm lost as well on what exactly you don't understand. Are you familiar at all with minecraft mods? If your not, then that makes a lot of sense, and I'm not sure honestly if this is the server you want. Most if not all mods either improve the UI, gameplay design, or simply add stuff to the game. The collection of mods I've chosen (as do most collections in all honesty) do all three. Furthermore my specific collection and configurations create a scenario that severely increases the difficulty of the game, although not without reward. What are you looking for in a server?

WHY ARE WE YELLING!!!!!!
Yeah, I don't even know why keeping eye contact is a thing. Like, why do you want me to look at your eyes? I suppose that's just a characteristic of our current culture or something. Sometimes, people will even think that you are hiding something from everyone. Yeah whenever people see me as different I am glad, because that's actually what I am and so I feel like they understand me a little more.
Yeah, that's a really good point, and something that I think about quite a bit. You're right, most of those artists listed are not exactly my cup of tea, though I can enjoy them when the my philosophical reservations don't come into play (except FUCK Dre, he's not only misogynistic to fit the norm in 'his' songs, he's actually a woman-beating piece of shit). newlinechar  newlinechar It is sometimes okay to separate your philosophy from your entertainment, but what's troubling is that participating in that entertainment is implicit endorsement of its content. If you buy an artist's music, or even just listen to his/her music and tell your friends, you are giving their voice an even larger platform, for better or worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying I need to know the exact breakdown of every artist's views before I'll even consider listening to them. In fact, sometimes I can agree with an artist about most of their personal views and want them to shut the fuck up about it (for me, that's Killer Mike - sure, he's smart, but he's not *that* smart, and most of his commentary about social and political problems *in his music* comes across as short-sighted and shallow, unfortunately). I just try my best to listen to artists whose worldviews are compatible with mine, and failing that, artists whose worldviews are not overtly offensive in their art or personal lives. newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, I am still very guilty of listening to music that I really don't agree with. Like I said, I think about this a lot, and I struggle with it, because I believe this shit matters, art matters more than ever. Art connects people in ways that blow my damn mind. I hope that the hip-hop community continues to become more open and accepting and less about patriarchal subjugation. There are always going to be assholes, in any area, who stick to their nasty ways despite changing times and understandings of the world. Think like Westboro Baptist Church compared to Christianity, or ISIS compared to Islam. Point is, they're the vocal minority, and I wish the artists who see sexism in hip-hop would be much more vocal about condemning it than they are now. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry that ended up being so long.

As a kid I loved the Orca, but once I found out WHY it became the orca it left a bitter taste in my mouth I haven't been able to get out. Honestly I don't like any of the Canucks logos whether its the V, the skate, the orca, or that ridiculously cartoonish Johnny Canuck. I find it hard to believe they can't hire some graphic designer to come up with something a little better.  newlinechar  newlinechar I really like the color scheme, it screams Vancouver, and think it fits the team better than any logo we've had ever did. The current/recent Canucks are typically not the style of team that could pull off the strong black/yellow jerseys of the early 90's imo. No idea WHAT would be better, thats for someone a lot more creative than me to decide, but man have we had a bad case of identity-crisis since our induction into the NHL.

No, I don't see the concept of property as metaphorical. Property is real, and isn't going away. What I meant is that the segment of the left who still talk about these traditional Marxist goals (abolishing property, seizing the means of production) usually do so in a metaphorical sense since the modern global economy makes engaging these goals at face value much more complex. You can't actually, literally abolish property in the US in 2015. That can't be included in any sort of practical political ideology. Which isn't to say that there aren't some fring reading groups and the like that talk about these things, but they are usually just whacking off intellectually.

What I love the most about Dark Souls is that regardless of knowing the structure, the nature of having everything set in place means that there's time to focus on that question that nags you in the moment.  To go through the game and reflect.  And because you can't put that on the back of a box like a feature, it's easy to take for granted.  I'd prefer that, rather than the tedium that is feeling that the novelty of procedural generation, you having so succinctly defined its logic, is taking away from that process of examining why the environment is constructed the way it is.  Why an enemy has a certain item.   newlinechar  newlinechar Those are mere fragments at best as they appear in Chalice Dungeons.  But this game is still a worthy successor.

Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following: newlinechar  newlinechar * General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it. newlinechar * It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones. newlinechar * Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body. newlinechar * On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was. newlinechar  newlinechar If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends. newlinechar  newlinechar From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind.

If they're choosing that, that's really their problem and not a problem to women as a whole.
Didnt see it either. Thanks nbc

Does that justify cussing about a kid? The teacher is drawing a paycheck, they did pick teaching as their career of choice. This is not something they were forced to do, and frustrated or not. Venting like that is not ok.

Thank you so much. You always give such thorough and thoughtful replies. I am still trying to process the 10 days of constant disrespect and abuse, honestly, and I don't know what my next step will be. I do know that I am so sickened by the entire situation that I have no intention of seeing him or acknowledging his existence any time soon. He has combat PTSD so I am really trying to be understanding and a good woman, but this sort of treatment is going to break me. He has no rights over me, my belongings or my son, though, thank god. 
So, just to tell this story, because it's funny. My MIL bought my son a Spurs shirt that said 'I want some nasty' on it.  He was never, never, NEVER allowed to wear it to school. This year he put it on after his shower and I told him that he needed to change his shirt tomorrow before school. (He sometimes forgets and it's not my hill to die on, because everything with this kid is a battle.) He said, 'Okay.' I kissed him good night and that was it. For the record, he has no idea what it means in the real world, just that the coach wanted the players to play harder. I'm sure you see where this is going. He put his sweatshirt on in his room, and in my sleep fog I totally forgot about it. I have terrible cell reception in my house and when the school called the call never came through, but they didn't leave a message. So I had no idea until he came walking up to the house, and he was wearing his sweatshirt around his waist.  The kicker? It was picture day. Awesome.

'Come to work with a positive attitude' is part of the job description for pretty much every job you'll ever have.  Try getting to work with a better attitude.  If you need to get up earlier and work out or something to get through you 'bad morning time', then do it.  It will serve you well in life.
As a 15m SP character I don't think it's a good idea, in my mind it's very reminiscent of the current trend in mobile games, a rush to the top, then a large plateau of maxed players staring at each other and wondering what the fuss was about, then quitting because they beat the game. You don't beat Eve, it keeps you coming back because it has depth. I'd much rather have only a handful of you 100m SP guys around then a handful quitting every week. The system in you're OP streamlines progression into a very meaningful process, simply chopping off years of that advancement doesn't, it simply throws Eve into the 'fast food mmo' pool with so many others.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: didn't realize you were OP :/
To be fair, fat people aren't supposed to be going to FPH to begin with. I like that there's a place specifically reserved for it, though, despite the fact that it doesn't encompass all of the fat-shaming sentiment to be found on reddit. That there are people that find fat physically disgusting, and gluttony reprehensible, comes as no surprise to anyone, I'm sure. newlinechar  newlinechar There are, in fact, a number of overweight people in my life. Many family members are obese, even. It's possible I suppose that some of them are unaware of my thoughts on their self-abuse, but those ones aren't really the type to pay any mind to the opinions of others. The rest are pretty well aware by now, since my being vegan long ago got them started on thinking I was shaming them by not eating their cooking. One relative in particular is endlessly frustrating due to being a very intelligent, genuinely nice guy who some years ago resigned himself to the fact that the complications of his diet would lead him to a debilitating and demeaning end, and is unwilling to make any changes in spite of knowing that. newlinechar  newlinechar Say whatever you wish to me; feeling ashamed requires agreement that something is shameful. It's not something that can be forced on anyone.

You're right that people often fall off their diet and gain the weight back, but the body doesn't want to store fat? Really? That's biology. Fat is an energy source when times are lean. Your body stores fat as a way to make sure that the body can survive as long as possible without food.

I thank you for the response as this actually is some good stuff to think about, however I don't entirely agree with some of your opinions (setting aside what Nick was saying or meant for now). Namely because it's ignoring that we're ALREADY getting broken games on the market even without companies able to lean on modders to earn more money for shipping out a broken product (Assassin's Creed Unity comes to my mind), and this in of itself I think breaks down a fair amount of your reasoning because they don't have to ship out a broken product for the sake of relying on mods, but mods can certainly reinforce an already existing and shitty business practice. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I do feel confident that all of that said the free market WILL work itself out, since gamers seem to be able to band together to say lash out at Valve for this paid mod stuff, I imagine that these broken games won't thrive in the long run and eventually companies will not ship out shoddy products regardless of the modding scene. newlinechar  newlinechar However, TB has himself voiced concerns when games offer to sell say experience boosts and how it worries him that they might have made it take longer to level up naturally to better sell it, and I think this fear of abusing paid mods to be of the same vein, but I also imagine that some people would get upset and fix any bugs and release those mods for free, even if there are 11 paid versions, someone will make a free version for the same reason we have free mods existing in the first place, to better the game. newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, my third paragraph in the previous post was about my issues with how Nick dealt with this subject (regardless as to how paranoid or optimistic either side might be), he seemed to only spend a few seconds on the aspect of these notions being absurd for what they were at the beginning and end, while he spent awhile talking about how Bethesda wouldn't do that, how Bethesda releases such quality DLC, how mods just don't stack up to what Bethesda does, so Bethesda would never use paid mods to replace DLC, and TB and Robin needed to come in and point out that everything Bethesda touches isn't perfect and made of gold, but that doesn't change the fact that Bethesda in of itself is irrelevant to the issue because again, even IF things go perfectly for Bethesda games, IF the system is broken then it's broken and OTHER companies at least will use it, which he didn't really spend any time on. He dismissed the concerns as being from conspiracy theorists, talked about how Bethesda would never do it, and once again dismissed the concerns as being from conspiracy theorists, I don't think he ever supported his arguments, he left it up to the listener to make up his reasoning for him and while I think I understood what he meant the fact that he spent more time talking about how Bethesda wouldn't do these things rather then the how say Valve/EA/Ubisoft wouldn't do them left me feeling like he didn't even understand the issue in the first place. All that time he spent talking about Bethesda was what was supposed to be supporting his argument that these concerns are paranoid fantasies, and if he can't seemingly 'support' his conclusions without going off-topic then I don't think that he really knew what the issue was in the first place (assuming that he wasn't maliciously putting up a smokescreen to straw-man the concerns, which I really don't think he was trying). newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, even though I am critical of him, and perhaps even too harshly in this post, I did enjoy what he had to say in a number of places and did enjoy his perspective at times, and I have a lot of respect for someone whom can be so dedicated as to be in the modding scene for 10 years putting out such good content, but just like anyone else his opinions and ideas must stand on their own merit and not just that of his character. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for rambling and for if my previous post misrepresented how I feel that how Nick supported his argument was inherently irrelevant to the discussion. I thank you none the less for your thoughts!

It is execution if you are being arrested for a crime you have not yet been convicted of by a jury. A cop just suspects you're guilty and causes your death. Was that friend of your family's death an accident? Maybe. But I would feel a whole lot better about that circumstance if I knew there was an independent body of individuals that looked into it and said, 'Yep, everything looks above board here. There was no falsified documents, no misleading statements.' etc, etc. How many times have we found out later that police misspoke or outright lied on their reports (I mean, we often say eyewitness testimony is unreliable and then somehow we buy into police testimony as gospel for some reason)? I really worry that police departments are only accountable to themselves. As they say, 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'
That's good to know!  I don't have that amount at this time (low income) but I'll keep it in mind!
