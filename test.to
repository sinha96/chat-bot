It does that one thing correct. It is designed to measure the accuracy of your circle based on the requirement of there being 3 points.

Yes, because everyone can just have those things.. its just that simple! I don't know why you just think that the girl HAS to be at blame somehow.. and you mentioned a situation that she was 'helpless' because no one was around so she is dumb. Honestly, even if people were around, most of the time people don't want to get involved and would be likely to ignore that something was even happening. You are getting at me as if I am acting like its a simple black and white situation - but honestly you are.. you're saying that if someone doesn't have someone around them and something happens to them - they are dumb.

This was in high school, and she was a Spanish teacher. We had a lot of class clowns in that class, and since this was Spanish 2, she knew a lot of them. There was this one such class clown (Kid A) who broke his arm and had it in a cast. One day, he had it resting on top of the desk. Another class clown (Kid B) threw a paper airplane toward Kid A's direction from the other side of the classroom. The teacher turned around and saw the airplane and got mad at Kid A for throwing it, despite the fact that it was flying towards him. Kid A, and the rest of the class, tried to defend him by saying that he didn't throw it; his arm was on the desk because he was resting it there, not because he threw it. She didn't believe any of us and thought we were all fucking with her, so she started ranting about pass incidents. She blamed us for the paperwork she lost and said she found our tests in the recycling, and that one of us must have done it. I think she got mad because we were all denying it and trying to cover for one another. So in the end she called us all little shits, and then told Kid A to leave the classroom to go to the detention room. Kid A didn't want to leave because he didn't do anything wrong, so she had to phone the school security officer to escort him out. I think she's still teaching there. I know for sure that she taught there for the entire duration I was in high school, and I only graduated high school a couple of years ago, anyway.

&gt;This cannot be the case. After all, one of the offerings brought by a sinner was the korban minchah, which was made up of flour.1 We also find in the Torah that both incense2 and monetary donations3 served to atone for the people.4 It should be noted that nowhere in the Torah is it stated that atonement can be found only through sacrifice, never mind blood sacrifice.5 newlinechar In Temple times, an important part of atonement was normally a sacrifice brought to the Temple. But where does that leave us today, with no Temple and no possibility to sacrifice? Let us look to the Torah for a precedent. newlinechar In the book of Jonah, the people of Nineveh had sinned and G‑d was going to punish them. When Jonah showed them the error of their ways, they fasted and prayed, and were forgiven. The same thing happened in the book of Esther. Living in Persia between the first and second Temples, they fasted, regretted their sins and were forgiven. These historical examples clearly show that when there is no Temple, sincere teshuvah (repentance) is all that G‑d demands newlinechar  newlinechar via [Chabad.org](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/630900/jewish/Atonement-in-the-Absence-of-Sacrifices.htm)

Yeah but I'm coming from Philly suburbs. The easiest and quickest way to NYC is picking up a train in Jersey.

#####&amp;#009; newlinechar  newlinechar ######&amp;#009; newlinechar  newlinechar ####&amp;#009; newlinechar  [**Abraham**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham): [](#sfw)  newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;__Abraham__ (/ˈeɪbrəˌhæm, -həm/ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): אַבְרָהָם‎,  listen (help·info))), originally __Abram__, is the first of the three [biblical patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible\)). His story, told in chapters 11 through 25 of the [Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis), plays a prominent role in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The narrative revolves around the themes of posterity and land rights. Abraham was called by God to leave the house of his father [Terah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terah) and settle in a land which was already settled by the descendants of [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan_(biblical_figure\)); however, God promised it to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates were put forward who might inherit the land after him, but all were dismissed except for [Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac), Abraham's son by his half-sister [Sarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah). Abraham purchased the [Cave of the Patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs) at [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron) to be Sarah's grave when she died, thus establishing his right to that land. In the second generation, Abraham's heir Isaac was married to a woman from his own relatives, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any right to his inheritance. Abraham later married [Keturah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keturah) and had six more sons, but on his death, when he was buried beside Sarah, it was Isaac who received 'all Abraham's goods', while the other sons received only 'gifts'.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Bible's internal chronology places Abraham around 2000 BCE.  Despite this, 'there is nothing specific in the Genesis stories that can be definitively related to known history in or around Canaan in the early second millennium B.C.E.'  As a result, 'it is now widely agreed that the so-called 'patriarchal/ancestral period' is a later literary construct, not a period in the actual history of the ancient world' (Professor Paula McNutt).  The majority of scholars believe that the [Pentateuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentateuch) was composed in the Persian period (roughly 520–320 BCE),  as a result of tensions between the Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the [Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) and claimed Abraham as the 'father' through whom they traced their right to the land, and the returning 'Priestly' exiles who based their claim to dominance on [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses) and [the Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus) tradition.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;==== newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/Ns2yoaY.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_035.jpg) newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^Abraham ^Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lake) ^| [^First ^inauguration ^of ^Abraham ^Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Abraham_Lincoln) ^| [^Attila ^Ábrahám](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila_%C3%81brah%C3%A1m)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqugn4j) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cqugn4j)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

I think this is a pretty good season and I have really enjoyed all the episodes thus far. I also don't hate every single person in the game like some do. You don't like the way the story is being told, I get that. I don't like the Godfather and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Doesn't do it for me. Did I watch it wrong? Just because I don't enjoy a story doesn't mean it's shit or 'hot garbage'. You have every right to your opinions, but don't expect people to not put you in your place when you call them facts and tell people that they can't watch a TV show correctly since they disagree with how you view it.

Firstly, I didn't think I was defending a position, I thought I was having an interesting conversation. Secondly, when you picked out what I thought was the least relevant portion of my response, I didn't have much to say that I thought would be interesting or very relevant to the conversation at large. So I made a joke, instead.  What was I supposed to do, ask you to respond to a different portion of my comment? Wouldn't have been a big deal at all, but apparently you were perceiving this entire conversation as some sort of adversarial debate, even though I alluded to this being an interesting conversation and even complemented your writing. So that's on you. Whatever, I'm done.

Well... yes. You can waive your 5th Amendment rights (potentially) by speaking to police officers without the guidance of legal counsel. But that's not what I mean. I think LEO's (and possibly others) have a special sort of clause about questioning when it's internal. If Internal Affairs  (or whomever) is investigating you, you can't 'plead the fifth' and not answer their questions about how you conducted yourself on the job. I think the flip side is that the information they may obtain can't be used against you for criminal proceedings - you may get demoted or suspended or whatever, but they're not allowed to turn that info over to prosecutors  (they have to collect their evidence on their own). Someone who knows more about this should probably elaborate/clarify.

On average you'll get one good spell, methinks, since you have a shot at two spells. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I really do think it's meta dependent.

I think if the ladder had a lot of Druids, Priests, and Warrior, then this card would be better than Ysera in, say, a control Warrior deck.

It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good.  I imagine many stories fail the test when there is a male protagonist, especially in truncated media like movies, because you don't have enough time to develop every background element to the same detail.  That would be an active hindrance in surreal works. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead. newlinechar  newlinechar Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.  Most romantic comedies for example are all about sex relations so it may strain a very fair screenplay to change in order to 'pass', unless it was done in a very trivial way that would seem to undermine the point of the test.
No coaching staff would have mattered. He does not even do simple things high school coaches drill into their players.

As valid as your points are, none of those things mean 'blowing it' in this context. Unless there's reason to think otherwise, one would interpret 'blowing it' to spoil one's chances of getting something, which kids normally achieve by misbehaving. newlinechar  newlinechar More to the point, kids aren't mentally developped until mid-teens at best, so having attachment issues or being easily frustrated really isn't something a child should be punished for.

When someone says 'based off the bible' the earth is 12,000 years old. They find this by using the book of genesis and the lineage of christ. Using an average for the lifespan of each generation. They arrive at the number 12,000. What the bible means when it says 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is 1 day means that god has no concept of time. It is a human idea to explain the way we perceive events.
I spent a lot of time searching for the best deals, motor with turbo and everything but ac compressor was $400, transmission was $200, timing belt kit and gaskets was another $300ish, the biggest expenses by far were the miscellaneous new parts.

Both tribes were out of rice. The comparison is even better in that the Barramundis just ate too much, whereas half of the NuHunahpus had literally nothing to do with being out of rice since they had just been swapped into the tribe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Craft is artistic intent, the way the story is constructed with tools like foreshadowing, easter eggs, irony, etc. It's the same as with a physical structure like a marble statue. An artist with true craftsmanship can add a bunch of details that a layman wouldn't be able to do in marble. Similarly SJDS has a bunch of compelling stories that weave through each other to make a tapestry, whereas this season has characters that have not been crafted for anything. Nina is the only person whose story really led somewhere. Shirin was a crafted character that didn't get any of the closure her story deserved. The others are without craft, and their stories are just 'here's a person, here's how they are, here's their finish'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Shit. In SJDS, even someone as low key as *Alec* had a compelling story of growing from someone who was petty and jealous toward his older brother Drew, and who let that enter into his dealings with people like Baylor, to someone who was alone at final 7 with a bunch of loved one pairs and realized that he missed Drew and wished he was there. Alec was a total douchebag and very sparse on confessionals/airtime, and yet the editors were able to craft a story for him that made him human and gave him closure. And they did that with like 17 other people too. Which is all to say we should not have someone in this game like Tyler or Dan who we know literally nothing about aside from that their boringly awful and awfully awful respectively. They have no growth, no arc, not even hope for a villainous downfall now that Shirin is gone. There's no craft to their stories, just basic ignoring and mocking, respectively.

Basically, as you pushed off, you imparted the same amount of force onto the desk.

That may temper the reality a bit, but if that was the point of the review then it is either poorly written or maliciously edited.  Reviews are notoriously bad in terms of having some useful criticism mixed in with a lot of useless comments to which the authors are expected to respond with a counter comment.  You get a lot of reviewers having a biased view of the work or trying to get their work cited in the paper.  That is just how things work.  But if the excerpted comments are representative, then the reviewer either failed to make their point or clearly crossed the line into flat out sexism.
It's a good show. I thought it was pretty emotionally engaging at times, and some of the humor was funny. The art is great, and the music is nice. It isn't amazing and I also despise the ending, but it was very enjoyable to watch. I think it is worth finishing.

&gt; I obviously meant the 'reality' we experience in dreams is dependent on us. newlinechar  newlinechar Thats not reality, thats subjective experience.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So hypothetically speaking, what if that's all there is?  newlinechar  newlinechar Impossible, there would have to be something beyond it for it to exist in - you know - reality - objectively. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Say one's mind was an AI construct and one's reality was a simulation run on the same computer.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then the computer would be the objective reality, and the laws of our 'universe' would be determined by that computer, but it would still be ab objective reality independent of us, and that computer would have to exist in a reality wouldn't it? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In the case of a self-sustaining dreamworld, reality being dependent on consciousness would be objective newlinechar  newlinechar No it would not. Reality is not the same as subjective perception. reality is the external system that is all of time and space as a whole, with constants and so forth. It is independent of us. The dream would just be that a dream for which the experience of the dream would be dependent on the reality of the computer and the reality within which the computer resides. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

The anavar is there for collagen synthesis and joint protection. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's my ideal stack for looking and feeling incredible with a huge libido, minimal sides, and still making solid gains. newlinechar

It's only been one of the biggest points in the campaign:  raising the corporate tax rate to 12%, instituting a progressive income tax scale, etc... and it's been gone over in this election numerous times including having been a focus in the debates.  So for someone to come on here saying 'they don't have a plan' when they've detailed it and their opponents have discussed these details is just downright idiocy.
[](/facehoof) Damn it. I am aware of that, but this is not the first time I make that mistake, I have to be more careful about it. Thanks for the correction. newlinechar [](/sp) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I assume you translated from 'el gente,' the singular collective noun? newlinechar  newlinechar [](/sp) newlinechar  newlinechar [](/twiponder) Normally I try to avoid thinking in Spanish before I write something in English. Specially lately, I am trying to be more fluent with my writing. But, since you ask, 'el gente' is not correct in Spanish, because 'el' is an masculine article and 'gente' is a feminine noun, so the correct form to say 'people' is '**la** gente'

taken within the context of the framers, it was so that civilians could be assembled as an instant militia, owning their own weapons and being able to bring those with them, in the case of another war on par with the revolutionary war. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' newlinechar  newlinechar everyone ignores the first 4 words... a well-regulated militia refers to soldiers, and the necessity for them to be armed and following orders in order to defend the nation.  after the revolutionary war, they wanted to make sure that anyone could be called upon to fight for the country without also having to bear the burden of arming everyone at once.  so if you let people bring their own guns, that problem solves itself. newlinechar  newlinechar today, we have a disgustingly well-funded military.  citizens who join the military are not required to bring their own guns, because the military will outfit them with what they need.  as far as i'm concerned, the military needs assault rifles, but civilians do not.

I'm not worried about working out with kids at home, I'm currently working on my phD so I have to spend a TON of time reading, writing, doing lab work, etc. I always find time to work in some exercise! I try and do cardio all at once, since 40+ minutes of high cardio is important, but sometimes when I have a 10 minute incubation or a 15 minute break inbetween writing I'll do sprints up the stairs, a set of 50 lunges, or shoulder press with the weights I leave in the lab :D

And how the fuck does that relate at all to the tweet in question? The only way it's relevant to mention that resisting potentially offensive 'expressions, tropes, or stereotypes' can be useful to a society in a discussion about that tweet is if that tweet is somehow in the same vein as any of those things, which it isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason the guy got fired is because it's PR and anything that offends anyone is a no go (unlike real life), not because it's actually bad at all. And it isn't. So the people who are offended by the tweet are not somehow vindicated because the same criticism that points out why they're full of shit here has also been used unsuccessfully against stereotypes etc that actually were bad for society. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: just because people who have crusaded against political correctness have been full of shit before doesn't mean the people doing it in this instance (basically just because a dude lost his job) are full of shit now.

On the other hand, you don't necessarily need a formal agreement to have cooperation through common interests, and avoiding formally cooperating dodges some of the easier lines of attack that would otherwise be convenient fodder; a way to blame anything and everything on (simultaneously) that damned interfering SNP *and* on a Labour party/leader too spineless to resist their demands. newlinechar  newlinechar If they go for it without any official agreement but it just so happens that they tend to propose things that the SNP are inclined to support, then Labour can claim full credit for getting stuff done, while also saying that they're demonstrating either the ability to keep the Scots in line or a broad-based appeal (depending on exactly who they're directing that message to), and the SNP can tell *their* supporters that it happened because they pulled the debate that way.

Yes. Many episodes are frollicky and happy adventures, but many are dark and twisted and ugly in a brilliant kind of way. There are deep, eloquent emotions in the story archs, pain and exquisite joy in the Doctor's eyes, love and loyalty in the companions, and super killer robots and aliens along the way. The show has the perfect gimmick - a machine that can travel anywhere in time and anywhere in space, which basically means they can do whatever they want whenever they want. They travel to distant planets, to the end of the Universe, back to Victorian London, and even to the afterlife. It's super-natural, it's scientific-y, and it's raw and unashamedly-human... it's remarkable, and so are the characters you meet along the way, like Captain Jack Harkness and the companions.   newlinechar  newlinechar Give it a shot, it's hard to be bored with such a spectrum of adventures and stories. I'd suggest starting with the season where they rebooted the series with the 9th Doctor. The first episode almost turned me off, but the second one was breath-taking,  and hit me square in the feels. Plus I like aliens, and that episode is full of them. newlinechar  newlinechar  One thing to understand going in, The Doctor is not human. He is an alien, and when he dies a mortal death, he is regenerated into a new body but with a slightly different persona and a general, sometimes spotty, remembering of his previous incarnation. He is still him, The Doctor, the same guy, just... different. This is why you hear things like '9th Doctor' and 'I like 10 the best.' It's a neat idea that let's the show go on and on with new actors as the lead. Some are with us for 1 season, others are for 3 or 4.  newlinechar  newlinechar Enjoy!

It's Release to Manufacturing, however, RTM is the first build that consumers will receive. In the case of Windows, RTM releases go to the OEMs (Dell, HP, etc.) months before a customer can purchase it.

I don't want to reengineer the entire world, that's why I'm an anarcho-capitalist and support, wait for it, voluntary separation. Quit it with the strawmen. As for subjectivism, if we are pure subjectivists, nihilists, existentialists, etc., then our desired worldview is just as valid -- especially if established by voluntary means. There will be a co-incidence of wants; supply and demand. As for stability, stability should be assured over particular geographic areas if the community desires such through voluntary means; this could come by way of voluntary welfare-for-all of the ingroup and none for the outgroup if they are not productive or conducive to assimilation, or if they are a threat to long term demography (think mass immigration). Such would incentivize living while still protecting the potential contributions of foreigners. If you are someone from India or Africa who wants to work in high-skilled fields, and supports nuclear families, you would be welcome. The number of such individuals is limited, though, and the community should ensure the high quality of not only the immigrants but also of themselves; mass immigration defeats both goals. Crude Libertarians have a notion of magical immigrants often; environment matters -- lets achieve those conditions most amenable to achievement and happiness.

My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI.  It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into it (doctors, insurance, diet pushers).  In the same way, the Bechdel test is a simple way of looking at movies that in the aggregate but is too simple to draw any solid conclusions.  Such as: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;demonstrates inequality against women. newlinechar  newlinechar From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.  Maybe an MRA would hold a stronger objection to the premise of the test, but I don't have any issue with it as originally formulated.  I think it can point out a way that we can change the film industry, but not really say much about the level of inequality unless you define inequality as failing the Bechdel test.

You make a good point, however the hunt doesn't end because some hunter is killed by Gehrman. The hunt ends because the source of the scourge is wiped out.

As a European, I do tip in the US, and I think everyone is responsible for researching local customs before travelling anywhere - but I would also come at this topic feeling like the European way is superior because frankly it is. You earn a liveable wage, and often get tips on top if you do your job well (even if you don't sometimes - I think many Americans think tipping is totally unheard of here which is blatantly untrue, it's just most often directly related to service). You will always, always make a reliable, consistent income as long as you work the hours, which will always be minimum wage (which is also much higher in Europe) or above.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, tipping in Europe means something because it's not compulsory. Tipping in the US is a way for businesses to cop out of paying their employees properly. I don't think that thinking the European way is better gives me a free pass from tipping in the US, or taking out my problems with the businesses on their employees. But yes, sorry, but I do think it's superior for tipping to mean something and for employees to be paid properly and fairly for the work they have done.

I mean he is as bad is you could probably get in PoR without being Bastian or Lucia. His base stats are really terrible and he requires a bexp dump or heavy babying to become useful. The problem with bexp dumping is Marcia joins the same chapter and is more or less 100x more useful at everything. Then there is Mist who has her one moment and is a mounted healer, still pretty bad though but she has something that only she can do. In the next chapter you get Kieran. So there are way better investments when you get him. newlinechar  newlinechar Shinon has is early game use where he is practically invincible and can blick just about every enemy. Astrid gets Axes/Lances on promotion which then makes her better than Rolf since she will have 1-2 range and she has access to the knight ward as well. Bows also don't really have a special niche in  FE9, as weapon forging can push any unit into one rounding flying enemies. Also effective damage is 2x I believe in FE9 so they aren't even that powerful against flying enemies. Paladins can also get bows if they chose to, which lets them do Rolf's thing but better thanks to higher move and Sol. But they won't really since they have 1-2 range. newlinechar  newlinechar In short Rolf is a unit that needs investment when there are better investments who join at the same time, and what he does after investment isn't anything great or unique and most units can do that and more since they aren't bow locked. newlinechar  newlinechar But Bexp dumps and weapon forges fix everything so he can be useable like everyone else in PoR.

Fairplay for doing the difficult thing. I know it's easy for us to say, we don't know this guy, but he really sounds abusive.

That basically sets the precedent that he pushes you as far as he possibly can, and you let him because you want to be a good spouse, this is pretty textbook conditioning for an abusive relationship.
Aahh the secret: use a shampoo for dyed hair, wash and rinse in cold water, and most importantly, rinse until the water is COMPLETELY clear. If the rinse water is still tinted, that means there is still loose pigment, and that will readily contaminate your other colours. Once out out the shower, immediately squeeze as much water as you can out, then wrap it in a towel, then swap for another towel after a few minutes, then maybe a third. Drying it faster means less time for further loose pigment to transfer. This will also prevent you from staining your pillow cases and shirt collars!

A lot of people use the word unbalanced here when talking about RTG decks when what they really mean is too many weak cards, having 14 great cards and 6 weak ones is unbalanced but shouldnt slow you down too much, whereas vice versa it will make a big difference as the few great ones drag the others into a higher level than they can beat far sooner, meaning far longer grinding +1s for lower cards (switching to uncommon method is usually better here with this kind of deck) so going back to my first reply, its better to do that to balance out the middle of the team without moving up as quick for balance as opposed to stretching your deck with 1 higher level card that wont help in EX/KOTR and makes it harder for the back end of your RTG deck

Your argument still stands, I personally wouldn't say one is inherently easier to read then the other but that's just my opinion, but as a note compilers like `gcc` will actually optimize `printf` statements that only print a single string along with a ending `\n` into `puts` statements for you.

Yes,  that's what it said. 
It's realistic, though. Actual space programs don't engineer for optimal flight performance, they engineer for optimal cost performance. And the basic rule is 'engines expensive, fuel cheap', leading to as much fuel as possible to be put atop an engine. Also, seeing a gigantic rocket slowly ascent from the pad just looks epic. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, the first stage (boosters included) of the Ariane 5 (GS variant) produces a thrust of 15,175 kN at liftoff with a liftoff mass of 777,000 kg. Liftoff TWR of 1.9. The core burns about 231 kg of fuel per second. After the boosters burn out after 140s, it has lost 546 tons in it's boosters, and 32.34 tons in it's core stage, leaving the total mass at 198.66 tons. Thrust goes down to 1,015 kN, bringing TWR down to a whopping 0.5. My rockets never fall into negative twr during ascent, so I lowered launch twr to adjust.

I don't think it's that. There's two main reasons that are unrelated to 'not giving a shit about Sunni Arabs.' newlinechar  newlinechar 1. **The welcome one will receive and safety.** Us westerners know that Kurds are very pro-west and will welcome our efforts without betraying us.  newlinechar  newlinechar Other rebels have significant anti-western streaks and cannot necessarily be trusted. See all the western journalists/aid workers that FSA kidnapped/looked the other way and allowed to be kidnapped and handed over to JaN and ISIS. It's simply not safe for westerners to fight with Arab rebels.  newlinechar  newlinechar Drawing from my own anecdotal experience traveling through Southeastern Turkey as an American (my flair reflects my heritage/ethnicity/, not my nationality), the Kurds I encountered everywhere were incredibly warm and got excited without fail when I revealed my nationality. Arabs however (in Mardin/Hasankeyf/Savur/Urfa/Antep), while not mean, were often definitely on the cold and distant side and seemed suspicious of my intentions there. The difference in welcome that I experienced was staggering. (Turks were pretty warm &amp; hospitable themselves, but not to the extent of Kurds).  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course one is going to have the tendency to fight for the people that is more likely to appreciate your presence... newlinechar  newlinechar (2) **Easier distinction between which side is 'good' and which is 'evil.'** newlinechar  newlinechar Fighting for the Kurds against ISIS is the rare opportunity to unquestionably fight for the side of good in a defensive war against perhaps the most evil movement of this generation. newlinechar  newlinechar Assad vs. the Rebels, however, is a much murkier conflict with regards to morals.

&gt; It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think that a test is only meaningful if it assesses whether the characters and story are good? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead. newlinechar  newlinechar When I search for a definition for unbalance, the first noun form definition that I get is: newlinechar  newlinechar * a lack of symmetry, balance, or stability. newlinechar  newlinechar This is what I mean: a lack of symmetry. When I search for imbalance, the first result that I get is: newlinechar  newlinechar * lack of proportion or relation between corresponding things. newlinechar  newlinechar This is also what I mean. Both words seem workable to me; why would you avoid 'unbalance' in favor of 'imbalance'? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not. newlinechar  newlinechar Nor does it claim to.

For example, OP, here's a Chrisitian's recent answers to me when I asked this of him, and my rebuttals underneath (he didn't respond to my rebuttals): newlinechar  newlinechar ---------------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[Christian:] As you should know, it isn't the heart, it's the blood. newlinechar  newlinechar This makes no difference to my point. But I'll comment on it anyway. If it was the blood, then why couldn't Jesus have just cut himself and dripped some blood for God? Because it wasn't just the blood. It was the death. Heart stopping, brain ceasing, etc. But again, this doesn't make a difference to my point - why would God need 'blood' before forgiving us? We'll just get off on a tangent if we get into a debate about what part of Jesus' physical body God needed to see harmed before forgiving us - none of it makes sense. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;He didn't 'demand' anything, He WAS the innocent person newlinechar  newlinechar Who was he sacrificing himself TO? Are you saying God would forgive us if there were no sacrifice? If he wouldn't, then God did demand it, as a condition of forgiving us. God demanded it in the same sense that a mugger demands our wallet as a condition of letting us go without shooting us. Sure, we could refuse to do it, but then we suffer the consequence that God/the mugger has given us for not complying. So it is a demand, given that there is a consequence for non-compliance. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The concept of Original Sin was apparently not taught to you? newlinechar  newlinechar Of course it was; just another thing that makes no sense. Who decided that sin would be hereditary, God or someone else? If God is perfectly just, how does it make sense that he pins onto children the sins of their fathers? Would it be justice to arrest you for a crime your grandfather committed before you were born? newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, sin is an *action.* To say that sin is hereditary is like saying, 'If you wear a green shirt, then wearing a green shirt is hereditary.' How can actions be hereditary? It makes no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, that still doesn't answer the question of why God required an innocent death before forgiving people of sin. What use does God have with an innocent death? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is for justice, instead of all of us getting what we deserve we are gifted Grace via the blood of Jesus. newlinechar  newlinechar If we aren't getting what we deserve, it's not justice. People getting what they deserve is pretty much what justice *means.* If God wanted to give us grace, why couldn't he do it without requiring an innocent death first? You are just repeating the things I already pointed out make no sense. newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, what do humans do that is so horrible that we 'deserve' *eternal burning* for? How is infinite burning justice for *anything*? What does the average person do in their daily lives that you think should be punished by setting them on fire? The best you can do here is just say, 'Oh well I don't know but it's God's justice and we can't question it,' which is what Muslim terrorists say, too. And when you say we can't question it, that's just you admitting that it makes no sense but you don't care. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Jesus died, descended into hell and defeated death, sin and the Devil.  newlinechar  newlinechar Why couldn't God just do that stuff himself, without all of the sacrifice stuff? Isn't God omnipotent? Why couldn't he just snap is fingers and instantly death and the Devil are gone? newlinechar  newlinechar -------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar As you can see, his answers didn't make sense of anything, and actually added more layers of things that make no sense. That reply is what even pastors and preachers and even professional Christian apologists come up with, that answers nothing.

i also like that about FH. but one of the things i like about AHs videos is that they are so long. i have basically stopped watching TV because i get plenty of entertainment from AH. there are still a few shows i enjoy, but RT/AH has taken over the majority of my media consumption, and i am happy about that.

You're being willfully ignorant here. You can be against Apple products all you like, but saying they did nothing innovative with smartphones or tablets is just beyond ignorant. I don't know if you ever used a pre-iphone smartphone, but I used to. Windows mobile 2003 was god awful. It was such a nightmare to use, the interface was terrible, it required a stylus to use, and calling the browser on it a web browser was really a stretch. Unless you needed one for your job, there was no compelling reason to own one. It couldn't really do anything useful. newlinechar  newlinechar They did the same thing to the tablet market in 2010. You can't be honest with yourself and find a pre-2010 tablet that you'd actually want to own. They were heavy, clunky things with terrible interfaces and very little 3rd party app support. A 2010 iPad is still usable today. newlinechar  newlinechar The iPhone was the first smartphone that people actually wanted. It was easy to use, it was fast, the interface was clean and smooth, it was stable, and you could actually browse the web, the REAL web on it. When the app store was released a few years later, it created a completely new market from scratch overnight. Mobile development is a massive industry now, and it's basically all because of the iPhone. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm an android user, but even I realize that if the iPhone didn't exist, android and smartphones in general wouldn't exist in their current state either. Mobile OSes would certainly be better than win mobile 2003 was, but I highly doubt they'd resemble anything that looks like they do now.

ItI'm watching less content myself. But my point is that it's impossible to talk about how the company is going to die at their current rate without knowing what kind of financial shape the company is in overall. It's not like we're getting hints of them being in trouble like massive layoffs. In fact we're getting hints that point in the opposite direction, last week Burnie was talking about how the employee count is going to get up to (I believe) around 120 because of projects they'll be working on later this year. That doesn't exactly sound like a company that's freaking out.

I veer slightly more towards the scientific edge of things, too, which is why I take a more cognitive approach in my work, but something I love about applied psych is that it has that 'art and science' mix going on--empirically supported interventions that still rely on interpersonal effectiveness and intuition to really 'work.' My dad was a particle physicist, and I was always incredibly in awe of the work he did because I struggled to wrap my head around quantum physics at all. When I decided to go the route of the psychotherapist I wasn't sure what he would think--he was totally supportive and was behind me all the way. Bottom line, I think people (if they have the resources) should do what fits best with them.

My personal experience from using crossfire(7770s before going to a single 7970) is that when it works, yeah 7950-7970 performance(I did my crossfire when BF3 was popular and had no hassles). Once you enter a game that either is iffy or you have to manually make it work yourself then it gets tiresome. Did I enjoy my Crossfire experience? Heck yeah. Would I do it again?

I was also disappointed in some of Brumbek's comments. He was sounding almost conspiracy theorist by trying to say that most of the uproar was caused by people who aren't even part of the modding community, don't even care about modding and just wanted to fight about something. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, Dark0ne stated that the Nexus is just about to reach 9,000,000 members. I'm willing to bet that the large majority of those people quietly download and use mods. They may not post on boards or leave comments but they're there. Those are the people who came out of the woodwork during the whole fiasco to make their voices heard, not some shadow SJW group trying to start a fight. Brumbek really lost some credibility with me there. Not bashing him in any other way, shape or form. Just saying that comment seemed to be unsubstantiated and came from left field. newlinechar  newlinechar I looked at the whole paid mods thing with a level head at first too, but after thinking about it and listening to some of the most compelling arguments, I became firmly against paid Skyrim mods.

I'll reiterate: Make sure you talk to your squad leader and get to finance.

You arrived at your unit late October, sure, but were you living in barracks and getting meal deductions? newlinechar  newlinechar That said, if you did get the wrong amount it's probably because somewhere in the paperwork you/someone didn't accurately reflect when the entitlement began. I don't want to play barracks lawyer, but here are some common problems with BAS: newlinechar  newlinechar - It's an entitlement for YOU, when a dining facility is considered impractical for YOUR situation. newlinechar - The CO sets the start date of eligibility. If whoever filled out the paperwork didn't realize that your entitlement started in October, for a myriad of reasons, then they might have done up the paperwork wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, there's nothing reddit can do for you, and your situation has too many variables to even begin to make an educated guess with.

Yeah that's right, it closes once you enter, but run back up to it and just hang around and kill stuff from up there.  Like I said, the knights don't run up there and thralls come up very slowly one at a time so you can pick stuff off real easy.  It only get's a little sketchy when the ogre spawns, because at that point, mobs start spawning right by those doors that you'll be hanging out at.  So either move to the underground spot for ogre or just watch your back for them spawning around you.  I tend to just hang around by the door the whole time and when ogre spawns I just rocket/snipe him really quickly before the other mobs spawn.  Cheers!

No way, I'm curious to know which lab he's in now! Relatively small field, we know pretty much everyone in olfaction at Harvard.
&gt;I am not sure I grasp your question newlinechar  newlinechar My question boils down to functionality. If a union as described by the law is *different* than the one described by religion (despite using the same word), then as you mentioned, it's explicitly *not* the same topic. So there shouldn't be any particular issues with the legal standing, since it's not the same topic. newlinechar  newlinechar That is, if we simply renamed 'marriage' into 'union between two individuals' you'd have 0 problems. So why make a problem where there isn't one? newlinechar  newlinechar I 'union' with all sorts of people. I have male roommates. Companies union all sorts of people (male and female). I don't see what a union between two individuals should be limited. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The issue is with public gay couples, living out a lifestyle of sin in public. newlinechar  newlinechar So you want to restrict freedom? How do you determine whether someone is a couple? If I (a straight person) decide to go kiss a dude in public, be it for a bet, simply because I wanted to, or whatever. Is that a problem? newlinechar  newlinechar What about holding hands with another dude? What if I simply grabbed his hand to pull him somewhere? newlinechar  newlinechar Is it the intent that matters, or the action? If it's the intent, there's no way to judge (not that it should matter anyway). And if it's the action, you're gonna run into problems of definition. How do you define whether someone is a 'male' (so that both can be 'male' and thus initiating a homosexual action)? newlinechar  newlinechar It seems your problem is that either: newlinechar  newlinechar A. You want to ban the freedom to act. And to do things that cause no harm to anyone, besides disagreeing with something in a book. newlinechar  newlinechar B. You don't want to see the 'ick' of homosexual actions. newlinechar  newlinechar Either doesn't make any sense. So since you want to enforce religious viewpoints on others, how about *my* religious views? My views state that you can't be Catholic. Period. No if's ands or buts. And if you are, you are executed. newlinechar  newlinechar Deal?

It's my understanding that the way Cacique does their sizing, it goes DDD, then F. In US sizing, DDD = UK E, so F being Cacique's next cup size is theoretically equivalent to the UK F. Thus, if you're confident about the fit of your Cacique size you would be a 38F in UK size too, allowing for differences in different models.

Lol all children are different. You can't just generalize whether hitting works or doesn't. In my situation is was my mom trying to keep 4 boys from tearing up the neighborhood, so I think she had to do what she had to do. And when I say hitting I'm not talking about abuse, just enough to get the point across. If anything, it was the fear of getting my ass kicked that kept me on my best behavior, which subsequently kept my parents from having to discipline me; so spanking your kids or whatever is more to show them that they can't get away with everything, and there's consequences to their actions, and I personally think it's formed me into a fine gentleman if I do say so myself.

Here you go: ^\(\^.\^) newlinechar  newlinechar I have to admit, this one was difficult to make. The trick is to backslash-escape the left cheek-parenthesis and the eye-carets.

It reminds me of the quotation from Stephen Colbert - 'The more you know, the sadder you get.' I will read all of these different topics for school and just barely touch on them, and I want to learn more about them, but it just isn't feasible, and I realize that there is so much out there that is waiting for me to discover and learn about, and it will most likely never happen.

Agreed. Killing people while you have a system like that in place probably just equates to murder in some cases. Madness.
I don't think this is the case. As far as I know, only J'zargo levels up with the player. I have read that transforming a follower into an animal with the Wabbajack resets their level to that of the player, but I have never bothered to verify this myself. newlinechar  newlinechar I do think that followers are set to a level when you first meet them. Take for example Borgakh the Steel Heart, a female Orc that can be your follower, who lives in [Mor Khazgur.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mor_Khazgur) newlinechar  newlinechar Her level is set to the player's level, up to a maximum of level 30. Her armor is always Heavy Armor, but depends on the player's level. If you meet her at level 30 or higher, she'll be wearing Orcish Armor. At lower levels it will be steel if I remember correctly. newlinechar  newlinechar So if you have a favorite follower in mind it might be best to look up their maximum level and wait until you hit that before you meet them. That way they'll be at maximum strength.

Alright then, compare it to a child who habitually nosepicks in class, that's a bad habit if ever there was one. A teacher still shouldn't shame them about it, especially in front of the class. It's just not professional. They should tell the student not to do it, and if they persist, pull them aside after class, or maybe contact their parents about it. I just don't believe shaming is the answer when it comes to teaching.
You get people annoyed at others bringing up gear in the context of celebrities because the majority of the time, the physique in question is obtainable naturally (just maybe not in the same time frame).

It is execution if you are being arrested for a crime you have not yet been convicted of by a jury. A cop just suspects you're guilty and causes your death. Was that friend of your family's death an accident? Maybe. But I would feel a whole lot better about that circumstance if I knew there was an independent body of individuals that looked into it and said, 'Yep, everything looks above board here. There was no falsified documents, no misleading statements.' etc, etc. How many times have we found out later that police misspoke or outright lied on their reports (I mean, we often say eyewitness testimony is unreliable and then somehow we buy into police testimony as gospel for some reason)? I really worry that police departments are only accountable to themselves. As they say, 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'

Aw, I love Solas and I love his romance. If you think about it no Bioware romance really adds anything to the game aside from the romance itself. There is a whole massive world of difference between friend Solas and romance Solas. Yeah, maybe the different is just a few cutscenes, but isn't that the meat of all the romances? The really fun part is what you make up in your head in between the cutscenes :) I just find the whole character of Solas romantic in a poetic sense, regardless of whether the player character engages in a relationship with him or not. I certainly think his is the best romance in Inquisition, just like I think Zevran is the best romance in Origins, and it's fine if you disagree but I wouldn't discourage someone from romancing a certain character for the first time and discovering for themselves.

Yeah, but Pearl's DESPY win is never brought up as that controversial because of her stans, who factor into the disillusion. Having stans defending her every move to the detriment of other queens gets old eventually. For instance Pearl had the same exact factors going against the justification for her DESPY win that Kennedy did for her Spoof win (1. Mostly written by a teammate, 2. Win was a storyline one following a near elimination, 3. Win was based on strong execution over writing, 4. There were other contestants who arguably were funnier), yet these factors are brought up to Kennedy's detriment constantly and are praised but when someone tries to logically bring them up about Pearl they get attacked by the stans.

That's what attorneys make doing document review in Virginia.  A mom and pop fireworks stand can't afford to pay an employee that to work the register.  A one size fits all national minimum wage is super dumb.  The economy is more complicated and dynamic than imposing a national standard of what each and every worker must be paid regardless of job or industry.

Not really a fight IMO. I admit Nvidia making G-sync most likely led to amd turning freesync into an open technology that will be the display port standard.

OpenGL is open to everything, and is also becoming the more used option. newlinechar  newlinechar Mantle was also open to be used by nvidia, It gave really good performance increases.

Yes, but that doesn't apply to most simple aesthetic mods. There are a LOT of aesthetic additions that a lot of people want which shouldn't be too hard to add to the game at all. It's ridiculous that it took until 1.7.2 to add stained glass with how often it was requested.

The issue is, if you're going to have minimal spend on players, looking for promising youngsters and unknown bargains, then you have to ensure the administrative and managerial side of the club are run perfectly. On top of this, you need a manager who can work with limited funds, and who knows how to be an effectual motivator and 'Head Coach'. Pardew and Carver just aren't that sort of coach and that's hurting the club badly.

The head ice tech is in charge of everything the happens with the ice and everything at ice level during the game.  You do need some specialized training, which can be received through mentoring (which is kind of what I'm doing) or by attending classes hosted by STAR.

I AM THE LAW. 
The way it was implemented by Valve there was a lot of issues where people would have to buy mods (free mod x depends on paid mod y for example) or in many cases people had no right to sell mods (copyright issues, people using other people stuff without permission). Sure, I support the position of giving mod author an option to put their work on sale, as long as its done in a way that is not harmful, but helpful to a community and a modding scene overall. But my personal opinion is that cooperation, sharing assets and learning experience is one of the key components of the mod scene and introducing any kind of paid system ruins those aspects. The only way to preserve those aspects is to make free availability mandatory, while leaving paying optional. 
They're like that with computers to. I work on my Mac Pro like I'd work on any other computer. 
I definitely agree that if a man walked into a woman's bathroom it more than likely would not be in order to creep on some lady. I'm just saying that if that were to be the case, that's when I would feel uncomfortable with a dude in the bathroom. Trans girls? Not something I would probably give a second thought to. She can come in pre-op or post-op, I don't care. newlinechar  newlinechar On a side-note, you are also damn right about them being gross, women's bathrooms are for the most part the worse out the two which I will never understand. I worked fast food for too long and cleaned the bathrooms too many times to ever say that women's were the cleaner of the two. Why in the hell would someone stick a used pad against the fucking wall? Who knows, but it's a common occurrence.

I would agree, but given [how small those vans are](http://i.imgur.com/QqpJtiR.png) I don't see how a man can enter a van without a severed spine, but leave with it 80% severed, without something malicious taking place.  newlinechar  newlinechar It borderline defies the laws of physics to say he inflicted that kind of injury upon himself, especially considering he was restrained with his hands behind his back and in shackles.

Galatians 5:4 'You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.' Here, 'the law' refers to the law of moses. From my understanding of much of the letters in the new testament, the old law is sepererate from the teachings of christ, so it might be right to separate old testimate teachings from Christian doctrine. (ie Christians can eat shrimp despite it being against the law of moses)
But they're still not that great - and they're more expensive! And you have to go and find one after you've done your grocery shopping (and it's America, so you'll probably have to fucking drive to it). Yes, I CAN go to a bakery to buy good bread - but it's a pain that I have to, when I'm used to getting it at the supermarket with everything else. Even the shittiest, cheapest, store-bought, supermarket value bread is much better quality than good quality supermarket bread in the US. We're not trying to be snobby about it, it's just true. Your bread tastes like air.
Not necessarily if I hop in a st14 bubble from behind the titan I can shotgun melee him if he is running weapons of light or even blessing of light. Awareness is key I win 95% of those encounters. If it's armor of light bubble then it's a 50/50 shot with that tactic if I'm using my felwinters lie with final round. If i have a teammate with me and we're playing control sometimes it's worth it to sacrifice one to get rid of the bubble. So saying jumping into a st14 bubble makes some one a bad player is just a dumb thing to say.

Empathy that we evolved to have as a cooperative species. Same reason certain animals help each other out instead of just fending for themselves, like the story on the front page this week about the study involving rats who will stop pressing a button that gives them food, once they realize that it seems to hurt a nearby rat when they press it. Plenty of studies like this have been done. Animals foregoing their self-interest for the benefit of others is not a specifically human trait and thus seemingly does not need a magical soul from God in order to be that way.

Idk how recently this was in effect but he said in one interview that he went abroad and tried to shut out all music so that he wasn't influenced by anyone but himself.

On top of that, digit ratio (a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure) displays markedly low T exposure on average in trans women and high T exposure in trans men. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;------------------------------

I bought too early.  My understanding is that stock, it's not ready for either.  For trading, you absolutely have to upgrade the frame shift drive.  (for example, Having a profitable trade route 13LY away does no good when you can only jump 7 and there's no intermediate system.) newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, it's still fast stock.  But (as I learned, new to trading) it wasn't ready to be useful when fully stock.  Sold all weapons and defenses.  I upgraded most things to D.  Downgraded to Class 4 shields.  Had to buy another cargo rack.  Needed some money to buy the initial cargo load.  Etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Some people say you need like an extra 20 mil for outfitting a clipper, but I don't think so for trading.  I stripped my vulture, then sold it, and got part/most of the way to a trading clipper. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  On second thought, maybe it can do RES's nearly stock (with some weapons from your vulture) as long as you don't treat it like a fully kitted Vulture.  My Vulture was ridic in PvE.  You could probably RES as long as you watched your shields and boosted out of danger if necessary.  After all, you only need to tag a ship and let the police do the rest to get the $$. newlinechar  newlinechar Just don't be like me and do it too soon and have to worry about getting stranded in-system or not being able to reach any good trade routes, no insurance money, etc.  lol

A few years back, road accidents overtook heart failure for a month as the main cause of death in the country. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not trying to scare you or anything, I'm just letting you know that it might not be ideal going from one small town to another. If you stick to roads between bigger towns (pop: 2,000+), you should be fine. newlinechar  newlinechar You'll never be too far from *someone* here if you run into trouble, and most people are more than happy to help tourists out in a jam.

The problem is with how a lot of subs bring on new mods. It's really tough to get good candidates. We brought on a bunch of mods in /r/Apple a while back and it was a lot of work to sort and assess every applicant. newlinechar  newlinechar I think a big part of it is asking the right questions and not being afraid of making mistakes. Mod teams have no obligation to keep on mods if they cause trouble, especially if they're new. Sometimes applicants don't work out, and that's OK. newlinechar  newlinechar But a lot of mod teams get jaded, and so they rarely bring on new mods and never inexperienced ones from the community. Things stagnate, and the most active and vocal people tend to be the ones who mod a lot of subs. This can be helpful, to have a wide experience, but it attracts users who are dedicated to the wrong things, their ego and not the community. newlinechar  newlinechar Being a good mod is a lot of work, and in bigger subs it's rarely fun. So it's tough to find good people. They're out there, just rare.

It's a pretty fun game with some awesome multiplayer/co-op moments. Just don't go in expecting a layered or meaningful story experience out of it.

Probably a pretty fair comparison.  For whatever it's worth (considering that I've consumed a substantial quantity of lovely North Carolina People's Porter and may be more idealistic than normal), I think that the term 'ape' will come to encompass humanity along with the rest of hominoidea within this century.  Paraphyletic categorization is really historical in nature.  It's probably not going to survive an era when we have a decent understanding of evolutionary theory (except in a handful of cases, where it describes all organisms with a certain characteristic and excludes a genuine but important minority, like gymnosperms excluding angiosperms).

Oh, I agree.  But the best strategy isn't always the most successful when dealing with PUG/PF/DF/Farm groups.  The most successful strategies usually always put more responsibility onto the tanks/healers, and just lets the DPS tunnel vision the boss.  (e.g. Ifrit EX, Ramuh EX, Shiva EX, Steps of Faith, T6 &amp; T8, etc.)

Lol, it's fine, but I was referring to the PCR hearing she refused to participate in just a few years ago. The defense didn't present Asia because she refused to show up. When Sarah interviewed Adnan, he didn't mention that at all, or did he seem upset about it.

Go-fastiness  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're actually asking, it means 10 cylinders arranged in a 'V' layout with five cylinders on each side. Most cars designed for fuel economy have 4 cylinders (but laid out in an inline configuration, since the space works out better that way.) 
I agree it seemed harsh, the truth is that he's probably quite replaceable -- I don't see how hard it is to think of clever fun tweets about basketball without sounding creepy or using language that has some history of causing controversy.

Well, she wouldn't be the mother if she adopted it out. Kid would probably have two parents, actually. newlinechar  newlinechar And I just don't trust a kid that young to know what she wants to be, much less ready to go whole hog for 'single mother.' It's truly impressive that she did so well, and she must have had great parental and/or community support, but I still think it's tragic. Parents would shoo their sons away from her, and she wouldn't have the time to enjoy normal social development.  Who knows if she was working and gaining that valuable life experience. Though at least the kid would have been almost school age when she was looking for full time work.

I don't think it's a bad pick. I meant it more as a comment on the Raiders love for the vertical passing game. By most accounts I've read, Cooper appears to be a better talent than any of last year's rookie receivers. They need to figure out what they have in Carr and in order to do that, he needs weapons. Good pick for the Raiders.

A default method in Java 8, IIRC, can refer to other methods in the interface, but in this case we have a reference to an object instance field.   newlinechar  newlinechar The interface would have to have something like a `getBase()` method that returns the object that an implementation of the interface delegates to.  That would be rather weird to have in an interface—usually the point is to hide the base object from the caller! newlinechar  newlinechar JDBC has a [`Wrapper`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Wrapper.html) interface that's meant to support the concept of having such wrapper classes, but its documentation reveals that you can't reliably write default method implementations with it—if you invoke `wrapper.unwrap(Connection.class)` you're just going to get `wrapper` back.
He's so rude, and you're exactly right. He's demeaning. 
Yeah, that's a really good point, and something that I think about quite a bit. You're right, most of those artists listed are not exactly my cup of tea, though I can enjoy them when the my philosophical reservations don't come into play (except FUCK Dre, he's not only misogynistic to fit the norm in 'his' songs, he's actually a woman-beating piece of shit). newlinechar  newlinechar It is sometimes okay to separate your philosophy from your entertainment, but what's troubling is that participating in that entertainment is implicit endorsement of its content. If you buy an artist's music, or even just listen to his/her music and tell your friends, you are giving their voice an even larger platform, for better or worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying I need to know the exact breakdown of every artist's views before I'll even consider listening to them. In fact, sometimes I can agree with an artist about most of their personal views and want them to shut the fuck up about it (for me, that's Killer Mike - sure, he's smart, but he's not *that* smart, and most of his commentary about social and political problems *in his music* comes across as short-sighted and shallow, unfortunately). I just try my best to listen to artists whose worldviews are compatible with mine, and failing that, artists whose worldviews are not overtly offensive in their art or personal lives. newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, I am still very guilty of listening to music that I really don't agree with. Like I said, I think about this a lot, and I struggle with it, because I believe this shit matters, art matters more than ever. Art connects people in ways that blow my damn mind. I hope that the hip-hop community continues to become more open and accepting and less about patriarchal subjugation. There are always going to be assholes, in any area, who stick to their nasty ways despite changing times and understandings of the world. Think like Westboro Baptist Church compared to Christianity, or ISIS compared to Islam. Point is, they're the vocal minority, and I wish the artists who see sexism in hip-hop would be much more vocal about condemning it than they are now. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry that ended up being so long. Thanks for the interesting reply, Swagula.

Except the only reason why it escalated to fighting was because Tony's side decided that the Superhero's who were against it get no choice in the matter, before it was passed as a law. Even people who decided to just not use their powers anymore, which was allowed per the law, were forcefully conscripted into joining. Giving Cap and the Anti-Reg side all the reason they needed to completely take the option off of their table.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately, and of course IMO, Civil War is so poorly written that the conflict itself should be a non-issue in the world of Marvel. 
I think it depends on a lot. What I'm saying is that if they wanted folks on their side there are many angles they could've chosen that wouldn't have been 'our jobs are harder, we're superior fuck you' kind of connotation.   newlinechar  newlinechar I personally had an amazing interaction with a cop when I took my friend to the ER to get her rape kit/SANE done. I was so worried the cop was going to somehow shame my friend for the situation. He knew it too, I was preemptively defensive on her behalf (she asked me to stay during the whole thing). He was totally professional, super helpful (I'm about X feet tall and Y pounds, was he taller than me? Bigger/thinner?).   newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly I've worked with some cops while doing pick up orders (taking mentally ill folks to the ER as they are in violation of their court order for treatment) and some of them are amazing.   newlinechar  newlinechar And then there was a time when I was terrified because a cop was working himself up on a power trip and I was scared of what they would do to me.   newlinechar  newlinechar So I get what you're saying, I know there are shitty cops in this state. But I've worked with some decent ones. And I think that what you're saying may be true in some instances but it's not true overall.

Considering that he is unsure what to do about low brake pad linings, I don't think self repair is a good idea. I know a lot of people say 'brakes are easy' but you need to have some mechanical ability to do them and more importantly know how to check for and repair other failures in the system including stuck pistons and seized glide pins. Probably a safe bet to have it looked at professionally and see if the condition of the other brake pads. This could be done for the cost of an oil change and just asking them to check during the multipoint, get a quote while your at it and go from there.

Do they? How?   newlinechar    newlinechar Chaos is disorder. It derives its meaning by contrast to order. If there is nothing to contrast it to, then it loses it's meaning.    newlinechar    newlinechar Void is similarly derived by it's contrast to the occupation of matter, but with the further complication of being descriptive of a container. Thus, void space implies space itself existing, but lacking matter. But if space itself has not been created, then void too loses it's meaning.   newlinechar    newlinechar Therefore, neither could have existed prior to creation.

Yeah exactly. My guess though is he'll say Mike Conley was out or if he plays, too injured to guard Curry.

I hope this doesn't get buried, because this is exactly what is happening. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit. To clarify the propaganda piece because it seems to be unclear to some. 'In America they lynch Negroes' is a counter-argument phrase aimed at discrediting the person, in this case America, by pointing out their own flaws. This, however, is not a sound argument as the initial accusation still rings true and the counter argument, even though it has some inherent truth, is not connected to the initial accusation. They might both be true, but don't cancel each other out. Reducing this to a very simple argument: Kid A ' You hit that kid', Kid B 'Well you hit the other kid' (statement 2 might be true, but doesn't lessen the truthfulness of statement 1).

Yeah I do see your point, it's not hip-hop. If the post goes against the sub's rules then I'm all for the mods removing it. Then it seems that TPAB and FlyLo's albums (which aren't hip-hop per se either) have been gateways to jazz, funk or electronic music for some people on this sub. So maybe sharing some good jazz efforts from artists which have collaborated and arguably influenced the sounds of those albums, like Kamasi Washington or Thundercat (whose songs have been posted on this sub before), might make those people more interested in jazz per se.

Oopsie, you're right, I forgot to read to the end of the line: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;ὃ μέντοι Κῦρος εἶπεν ὅτε καλέσας παρεκελεύετο τοῖς Ἕλλησι τὴν κραυγὴν τῶν βαρβάρων ἀνέχεσθαι, ἐψεύσθη τοῦτο: **οὐ γὰρ κραυγῇ ἀλλὰ σιγῇ** ὡς ἁνυστὸν καὶ ἡσυχῇ ἐν ἴσῳ καὶ βραδέως προσῇσαν. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure though why your translation inserts the Athenian war cry into Xenophon's narrative, it's not there, at least not in that form: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;καὶ ἅμα ἐφθέγξαντο πάντες οἷον τῷ Ἐνυαλίῳ ἐλελίζουσι, καὶ πάντες δὲ ἔθεον newlinechar  newlinechar Now, 'ἐλελίζω' does mean 'to trill,' and is often used to describe the Athenian war cry ('eleleu eleleu') but the Ten Thousand were mostly Achaeans and Arcadians, so I see no reason why it wouldn't just mean here 'to raise a war cry,' the way it usually does. The singing of a paean is pretty usually as the beginning of a war cry, I didn't really consider those to be separate events--paeans usually ended with a war cry anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar The spears against the shields I think we're supposed to discount, and I think Xenophon wants us to discount, as does every scholar I can think of on the subject. Xenophon says: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; λέγουσι δέ τινες ὡς καὶ ταῖς ἀσπίσι πρὸς τὰ δόρατα ἐδούπησαν φόβον ποιοῦντες τοῖς ἵπποις. newlinechar  newlinechar But he rarely uses the verb 'λέγω.' The few times he does, as here, it's supposed to mean roughly the same thing as Latin 'ferunt,' except minus the aspect of a traditional story that 'ferunt' carries--it's something that Xenophon heard from somebody else but that he either does not think is true or he cannot actually confirm. In most cases it's simply that he can't confirm it because he wasn't there (like Meno's nasty end)--but he *was* at Cunaxa, and I don't see why we should not understand this as dismissive. Herodotus uses λέγω in the same way, it's rather a common usage of it. newlinechar  newlinechar In any case, I'm glad you pointed this out, it's important that the practice of silent marching and deployment was hardly unique to the Romans in any way!

&gt;You really dictionary-ceptioned me there so this may not be the best response since I'm on my phone but here goes newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I am so heavy in defining the meaning behind words is because of past conversations that were more personal interpretation rather than more aligned with the actual subject. I just didnt want to start a conversation without an understood basis of meanings. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that relies too heavily on trust. Its never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket and to leave control over the economic conditions of your community to a few seems a bit like animal farm.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some would be more equal than others simply because they are greedy for power if not money.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ok but if you are in a position where you want to have more than you currently do, what do you do? If you are in a community where things are rationed then what do you do to attain more than what you get? newlinechar  newlinechar John Stossel went to the Soviet union and while he was there, a boy asked to buy his sneakers. Now it maybe be ok to have a farmers market type transaction between people in socialism or communism, its still reflective on the boys desire for something more than what he had. newlinechar  newlinechar He grew up in a system where greed was shamed and profit was demonized, but he still bartered to gain something he did not have before. The shoes were a luxury to them, and there were just running shoes I think. newlinechar  newlinechar I dont think its possible to curve greed. Its a driving trait humans have. Yes, the worker who works for less now might not make as much, but continued labor and improving their skills only adds value to their portfolio. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly if I was guaranteed a job and would be paid the same as everyone else I would do an absolute shit job. I would stay there until im done for the day and then go home to do what I really wanted to do. You develop a mindset like the voting system now where you individually cannot make a difference in your community which can only be afforded to those who were at the right place and time. You know that owner of the car factory? He got that place because he gathered people together to build it, but does he make more than me? Nope. So why do it? Humanity? Civil service? I doubt many people would take a bullet for such reasons. I dont see the point in inventing anything else for any other reason than because you are bored. That or its a hobby.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also doubt there would be nearly three quarters of the people currently in science if it wasnt for the promise of a better life from a greater paycheck. Im not saying there aren't those that do it to advance science but not everyone does.  newlinechar  newlinechar If everyone got paid the same then I would never try to learn anything but working the easiest job I can find and then collecting that easy money.  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: words

A bunch of different groups emerged out of Ferguson after the riots there, many of whom seemed pretty radical.  A group called the Baltimore People's Power Assembly was at the center of organizing protests in Baltimore, so they might grow now.  The Bay Area has its own hodge-podge of radical organizations.  But in terms of whether there are any groups comparable to the BPP or the LRBW, definitely not--that's going to be a work in progress.

I have their Charlotte plunge, and I needed to size up in both band (firm elastic band across the bottom dug in a bit, so I wear it with an extender - if you measure closer to a 38 rather than sizing down for stretch this might not be the case) and cups (narrow enough but quite shallow, but gives a nice round shape for me). newlinechar  newlinechar And of course, if you want to order from Poland, Ewa Michalak is amazing.

I am a firm believer that there are two different kinds of shows that just happen to share the same tools to create the experience.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are concerts/pop shows, where the DJ has a pre-planned or pre-fabricated set to play - Sounds good, good music, recognizable tunes, big musical moments, etcetera. newlinechar  newlinechar and newlinechar  newlinechar There are parties, where the DJs goal is to read the crowd and generate an off-the-cuff set for the crowd to experience and enjoy. newlinechar  newlinechar I can totally see why loving the music of a producer and then going to see a well-crafted set with synced visuals and lights is fun. I've done that. I can also see why going to a show where four DJs who run their own record label are each going to spin for four hours and they just walk on stage with massive crates is a wonderful experience. newlinechar  newlinechar The community just needs to recognize the disconnect and stop associating the acts with each other. To me, if someone enjoys a Guetta set - awesome! Good stuff! It's not for me, but I'm glad they had fun! Just like how I'm pretty sure that not everyone wants to see Danny Tenaglia spin chugging NY-style house for 16 straight hours. newlinechar  newlinechar  Different strokes, different folks. newlinechar  newlinechar I call it a problem because people try to hide the fact that they are phoning it in. There is some false belief that these festival big-names are going out there and generating music on the spot, controlling the visuals with their CDJs somehow, and cueing the lights, when in reality it's more like the producer hops behind the decks, hits play, and then adjusts levels as necessary throughout the set. How many times can you find an AMA with a big famous DJ where someone asks 'How do you set up your lights to be so awesome!' and the DJ responds 'the venue does that, I have no clue' newlinechar  newlinechar If we were being honest with ourselves, the festival big-names sole purpose is to walk on stage and be seen behind the decks while the music plays.

Thanks! I miss them, but they are all still alive and well. They were bought by a family that lived with them at their own house that had an attached barn, just like I had. When I had them I would let the horses and goats hang out in my front yard when I was home. They were all family pets like dogs. I was so stressed when I had to sell them because I did not want them to get separated or sold to someone who would lock the horse up in a boarding facility and only visit him once a month. They all needed daily interaction and attention. So I was so lucky to find a home that would treat them the way I did. So I sold it to that family for a price they could afford. Because even though it wasn't the price I was asking, and I had higher offers, it was the family environment I was wanting.

I doubt it. I'm teacher of the year twice. Good teachers have a knack for making everyone feel loved and good about themselves. I'm a bad person for recognizing the obvious?

The difference is a professional chalks it up to teen angst and doesn't hold it against the kid for being a dumbass and does they're best to keep the kids ignorant of your true feelings by still treating them the same and giving them the benefit of the doubt for their behavior and shortcomings.  It's foolish to think teachers should for some reason not think about people the same way everyone else does. It's just that some of us know how to get even the worst kids to trust and respect you despite the fact that you don't think they have many redeeming qualities.

What I love the most about Dark Souls is that regardless of knowing the structure, the nature of having everything set in place means that there's time to focus on that question that nags you in the moment.  To go through the game and reflect.  And because you can't put that on the back of a box like a feature, it's easy to take for granted.  I'd prefer that, rather than the tedium that is feeling that the novelty of procedural generation, you having so succinctly defined its logic, is taking away from that process of examining why the environment is constructed the way it is.  Why an enemy has a certain item.   newlinechar  newlinechar Those are mere fragments at best as they appear in Chalice Dungeons.  But this game is still a worthy successor.

There is only one counter to LRM: Breaking LoS, preferably with a solid object that will take the hits for you. It's disingenuous to act like ECM is imbalanced vs LRMs when there are so many ways to overcome ECM and only one way to counter LRMs outside of destroying the mech using them.

The obvious: I'm just not interested in 6 on 6 based on how the games play out. It's too small, too many of the classes don't function as intended, and (sorry) I think it's too much about individual play and not the big, messy, NFL style scrum that attracts me to the game. Not enough improvisation, too many players are relegated to pure support. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm happy that people are going to get what they're looking for, but I'm someone who thinks HL, while acceptable, is a little small for my tastes. Nothing is better than the 12v12 matches I've had on good servers where everyone's actually playing and most of the field is pretty good.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather queue 10 minutes for that instead of 5 minutes for a 12 man match, personally.

I go down the shop for my brother from time to time to get food. It's about £4.40. newlinechar  newlinechar He offers to buy me the same meal. Tasty as heck, *definitely* worth it. Or I could just go down twice on any different days for him and get £7 for 7 Hearthstone packs. I could do the same with RP if I felt like it, I'd imagine. newlinechar  newlinechar I see 600 points as not too expensive but too cluttered. It would be more appreciable to me if the Chromas were sold singularly, with part of the reason being that it's potentially a 'forced purchase' for people who are seeking only one Chroma. With that being said, Riot could address this issue by introducing a 'Random Skin'/'Random Chroma' option, so you start with one you own at random each game. newlinechar  newlinechar Like you'd said, though; it's an insanely low price barrier. The *only* way this could be a significant issue to anyone is if they have a severely limited budget and the difference between buying 1 Chroma and 3 Chromas does actually mean a great deal to them. newlinechar  newlinechar But as I've said before, it's not a gameplay changer. It's not like someone trying to extort people in need with bread. In that light, it's arguable that there is no 'moral compass' to follow, since this is Riot's turf entirely and the only thing that could *possibly* prevent them from selling something on League of Legends is actual legislation. newlinechar  newlinechar Or people's wallets, of course.

All you're doing is spreading CoE's damage boost over a larger duration.

You will have heard this many times before, but 'an eye for an eye and we'd all be blind'.

I'm not really sure if there's much I can say against that other than I strongly disagree. There is no objective right and wrong but I think your frame of mind is pretty abhorrent. Human rights belong to all humans, regardless of whether they're a saint or a murderer. The whole point of human rights is that they're applied indiscriminately - the US seems to be one of the only countries in the world that doesn't understand this. You can't fight fire with fire - if you expect the public to behave, you should be setting the example. As far as I can see, support for the death penalty is cruel and ultimately very childish.

That is ignoring the fact that bristle should instead be stunned and surrounded, but octarine core is actually very good on him based on my testing.
Never said it was the only solution, but its a start. Another option is to stop acting like women are 'inviting' violence by leaving their own homes. I suspect that the public espousing of views like that ironically actually invites more rapes.

It's NOT genetics, it's calories.  If you overeat, you get fat.  It's science. newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of obese people are addicts - overeating is no different from being an alcoholic, a drug user or a compulsive gambler.  There is absolutely no reason for someone to eat as much as two or three people every day.  You do not need the energy.  Your body stores extra food as fat and that is harmful to your health. newlinechar  newlinechar If being obese was actually genetic, the rest of our bodies would have evolved to compensate.  In other words, our knees would be three times bigger to support 300 lbs. instead of 100 lbs.  Our hearts and cardiovascular systems would also be larger and stronger to deal with extra weight.  So it's not genetics.  That's just a straight-up bullshit excuse used by food addicts.  They're no different from alcoholics who make bullshit excuses to keep drinking. newlinechar  newlinechar The obese should join Overeaters Anonymous and work with a therapist who deals with addiction.  Overeating is deadly - it will kill you.  So stop with the bullshit excuses and get some help before it destroys your life.  I am sympathetic, but I'm also sympathetic to someone hooked on heroin.  I don't make excuses, I get on their asses until they get clean, which is what's best for them.  Same thing for overeating.
Fair enough, that's a pretty good reason. Good luck in California!

I disagree. The rangers have 5x multipliers between 525-725 to let them catch up because of that, hence why it's optimal to re-gild later Heroes once you can get your previous one to 1500 (or 1525 really) while still insta-killing. newlinechar  newlinechar I tried (and proved this) when I was somewhere in mid-game and wasn't even a frequent visitor of this subreddit yet, when experimenting on when I should re-gild from Atlas to Terra. Atlas was at 1625 and Terra was at 1100, meaning Atlas would have a higher DPS because of the extra 4x multiplier, but losing 80 Souls for each re-gild to Terra would still increase my DPS. newlinechar  newlinechar I would definitely advice to re-gild to whichever Hero you can comfortably take to 1000 during the run and use that for the push.

I'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal and I VERY firmly believe in the 9th and 10th amendment therefore I identify as a Libertarian. That doesn't mean I wouldn't vote for a Democrat or Republican if they also shared those same values, I'm just well aware that their parties don't and are essentially 2 sides of the same 'bloat the government and spend money we can't possibly bring in without raising taxes' coin. The second a 'social democrat' believes in protecting civil liberties without creating even more of a welfare state and further deepening the already 18 trillion dollar national debt I'd be happy to vote for him/her/xir/whatever. But that's the very antithesis of a 'social democrat' so I don't really have to worry about that. With a national debt of 18,000,000,000,000 dollars (or 60k per every man, woman, and baby and [*well over a million dollars per taxpayer*](http://www.forbes.com/sites/othercomments/2013/10/30/u-s-national-debt-1-1-million-per-taxpayer/)), The national debt is apparently way more of a priority for me than it is for either the democratic or republican party.

That's true, but they've also started the workshop and started paying for and using models made by the community.

Alright, so graphics editing tools usually have their colour picking and rendering of a graphic as HSV/HSL. These stand for Hue/Saturation/Value or Lightness. My favourite way this is presented can be seen as a box with a slider; the slider is your hue (colour from red to green to blue to red), the box's Y-axis is your value (from white to black), and the X-axis is your saturation (pure neon to no colour).  newlinechar  newlinechar Our eyes do not work within such nice confines, and the natural pigments of the world and the way they mix with light or surroundings also do not fit such a nice little box. Your appropriate range for a yellow, like Lee Sin's shirt, can have very minimal saturation changes, but to make the shirt look appropriately red and not numbingly neon, you may need to have a larger range between the saturation values for every shift of colour in every pixel.  newlinechar  newlinechar Simply colour swapping in an editing program doesn't accomplish this easily as far as I am aware, and trying to will only lead to improper colour shifts that look unnatural or oddly textured looking sets of colours. I may be wrong, but almost every example of a non-Rioter Chroma has had glaring issues because they essentially shifted the hue without adjusting the saturation and value. newlinechar  newlinechar Fizz is my favourite: his dreads on his base skin have almost no sheen to them where they are most illuminated due to how light of a colour his skin is, but two of his three chromas have very clear distinct light areas compared to the rather matte quality of the other chroma and his base colours: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-30rVTI7PXrg/VUJx1ngUeSI/AAAAAAAACwM/xdyNhAiT6Us/s1600/Fizz_Base_chromapack.png newlinechar  newlinechar If I'm wrong, someone please correct me.

I have attended many frat parties, and drank more then I should have at most, but rape occurs everywhere. You should be more worried about the random stranger that buys you a beer at a bar than a frat parties beer. First of all the beer is either canned or in a keg. They often have some sort of punch though, but I have never heard of anyone spiking it with anything other than alcohol. There was actually a case of a girl that was roofied at a frat party, but it was by a guy that wasn't in the frat, and picked the girl out and slipped it in her drink. You either attend a really shady school, or are just repeating horror stories you were told via word of mouth. No frat has beer in a manner that could be spiked. Like I said, it's either canned or kegged. The punch however, I could see some girls being sketched out. A standard bar has a higher chance of rape than a frat party though. 
Thanks for the info! 
That's how I survive. My issue stems from the fact that I'm 30 and the shows are usually filled with really rude 19 year olds who are drunk beyond belief and drugged up.

I have a possible motive - credits go to someone else in this comment section (find and up vote them, really good suggestion!) newlinechar  newlinechar His motive originally could have been to basically threaten the owner into selling. He could have done the first kill (the puppet) way back when when it was a diner, because he saw potential in the franchise. This lead to them not being able to cope with rumors of the murder, and they failed. Purple Guy then rebranded to Fazbear Entertainment and moved shop to a new locale.  newlinechar  newlinechar But something changed in purple guy. He liked to kill children. So, he used the store as a front. A successful one that children loved. newlinechar  newlinechar And he carried out his plan. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit; /u/King-Of-Zing newlinechar

Definitely stepping up his game when it matters. newlinechar  newlinechar I love the way he reads the play, and uses his energy and speed as a young guy. He sort of floats around, looking for interceptions, and covering passing lanes at both ends. newlinechar  newlinechar If he turns over the puck or if theres a break out he can turn on the jets. newlinechar  newlinechar I reeeally like his goal in the last game. He used his speed perfectly, by not just going full out, he skated as fast as he needed to maintain a passing lane and shooting lane for when he got the puck. Definitely a showing of great hockey IQ. newlinechar  newlinechar 
I saw him on an askreddit? thread, and saw his name. I wanted to see if he made his account on 12-20-2014, and he did, but I also saw he was a mod of this sub.

&gt; Its very unlikely that that would be 'the end of it' if there was a sub-optimal outcome from the birth. newlinechar  newlinechar Patients express wishes against the doctors instructions trump it. She wouldn't have been able to sue, he wouldn't have committed a crime. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Keep in mind that the obstetrician has two patients - both the mother and the child, and that he/she must weight the pros and cons of any intervention with this in mind. newlinechar  newlinechar The mother's wishes come first, until she is incapacitated (she wasn't) at which point it falls to the person she appointed or her next of kin. At no point, would that decision have fallen to the doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;From a medico-legal standpoint, the mother may not have been in a position to give or deny consent, depending on what 'sedative' she was given.  newlinechar  newlinechar She was awake and aware and capable of articulating a clear and coherent question, which caused the doctor to feel that his authority was impugned and then he assaulted her, committing a felony. That's mens rea and actus rea. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, I don't see the issue here. A doctor is not allowed to simply attack patients and patients do not surrender all autonomy the moment they walk through the doors of a hospital. A medical degree does not confer immunity from the law. Suggesting so undoes decades of advancement in medical ethics.

That will introduce a bias into their study. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, if we imagine a study that for example took 10 people(for easier visualization), 5 overweight, and 5 normal weight individuals. I can't be assed to look up the statistics, so let's say- 37% of people of normal weight develop alzheimers, (and let's assume our sample is completely average). So of the 5 normal weight individuals, let's say 2 had Alzheimer's disease when they collect their data on their subjects at the end of the study period. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They then go back to find their 5 overweight individuals. Let's say 1 of them had since unfortunately died due to health complications, So they drop them from the study. They find that one of the 4 other overweight subjects had alzheimers.  newlinechar  newlinechar -In this example, 25% of the surviving overweight subjects (1/4) had alzheimers, and 37% of surviving normal-weight individuals did. Does this suggest they have a 12% lower risk of getting alzheimers? Of course not- the confounding factor is of course the death. the issue of course is that this weights the statistics. I cannot think of a good way, myself, to 'account' for the confounding factor very easily. Even with very high sample sizes, it is necessary to presume that the factors of obesity that lead to a risk of death are themselves independent of any risk factors that would lead to alzheimer's disease. newlinechar

&gt; Again, the same lawsuits, the one I cited and a few others, like one where a teenager started a fire in a trashcan near his school which burned part of the school and the parent were rules not responsible for the damages by citing they were good parents newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar This sounds like a mischaracterization.  Again, I would need to read the case law itself, not a newspapers lay-interpretation.  But it seems to me that the Quebec civil code simply codified the tort of negligence.  IF thats the case, its not that the parents are not responsible as long as they were good parents.  Thats misconstruing the words.  Its that the lawsuit by the Quebec Gov't hinges on proving the parents failed to meet their duty of care in this situation.  In reply, the parents providing evidence of their adequate parental oversight were able to show that the duty of care was met.  Its not that the parents were not responsible....its the opposite, the parents were completely responsible for their kids...to a point....and that point was met.  There is only so much that can be done by parents with wayward youth.  But what type of duty of care is owed and how it is met will be different with each case and set of facts.  But since I can't find the actual case of CanLii, all of what I said could be incorrect.   newlinechar  newlinechar

Well, I'm relieved to hear that it's net :) A few things: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Do you weigh your food and log everything, including cooking oils? newlinechar 2. Are you eating back all calories? How are you calculating your burns? newlinechar 3. Do you eat a lot of sodium? Are your bowels regular? newlinechar  newlinechar For us smaller ladies, every calorie counts. Even pre-packaged foods can be off on their portions, so weighing out food could make a few hundred calories of difference per day. Most burn estimations include BMR, they're usually off by 10 - 30% and body fat percentage will affect that as well. I'd recommend only eating 25 - 50% of exercise calories back. Sodium and carbs make you retain a bit of water too, adding a couple of pounds to the scale. If you're still worried, talk to your doctor. newlinechar  newlinechar Congrats on the upcoming nuptials! Take this one day at a time, you're already on the right track.

TRP doesn't think it's a 'big deal.' It's just reality. BPers are the ones who think saying women are hypergamous is controversial. Hypergamy doesn't apply to men because hypergamy has to do with more than just looks. Money and status are 2/3 of what comprises hypergamy, together that's the majority. Men have their own separate thing going on but it isn't called hypergamy. Men care mostly about looks, age, and fertility.

Thing is they never explicitly said that would *actively prevent* people from modding the game. Rockstar has never officially supported modding, but everyone knows that modding has become a stable in the PC GTA releases, keeping the game alive for years past their prime. Thousands of players buy the games multiple times for the purpose of modding, adding dramatically to Rockstar's revenue. Gamers have come to expect modding. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, Rockstar is fully in their right. But that doesn't mean we as consumers shouldn't complain. This is a shitty practice and is a loss for all parties involved.

However much the cost of living in that area differs. It's not arbitrary, we can measure these things.  newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, CNN has a [cost-of-living calculator](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/) that breaks down the price difference in food, housing, etc. You could pick a baseline city that is right around the national average and then use that calculator to determine the equivalent salary in a different place.  newlinechar  newlinechar The numbers come from statistics and reports collected by [C2ER](https://www.coli.org/countylevelindex.asp).

That's a little bit disingenuous. We consider people in repressive societies to be forced into whatever task they are assigned.

True fat can be an energy source but it is not THE energy source; that is glycogen aka Sugar. When you eat carbohydrates (which should be the primary macronutrient for energy) your body breaks them down into glycogen and then your body stores this glycogen in the liver/brain/muscles. When you eat an excess of what your body needs in Protein or Fat it gets stored immediately as fat. You should try to never go over what your body needs for these for this reason: While if you go over in carbs your body can store the excess glycogen in these sites while also using the glycogen your body needs to function. Now when the glycogen stores are full the excess of glycogen gets created into fat hence another step. The human body is meant to function as a perfect high pace computer so doing another step makes the body slower and expend unnecessary energy. If you do not wish to take my word for it i will be more than happy to explain how it takes energy to change glycogen into fat.

Hey, thanks for being civil! newlinechar  newlinechar I will agree that there's a current issue in the industry of shipping broken games, but I also think, like you said, the free market is handling that.  I'm positive the next Assassin's Creed will run better than Unity, because Ubisoft was taken to task over that.  Likewise I agree there will likely still be a free mod to fix any glaring issues just as there is today, and the paid one won't sell very well at all because of it (hooray markets!).  I guess I just can't see the situation where a developer says 'hey, we've got this big bug X that is really a problem' and some mustache twirling exec says 'leave that in there, we can make money on the mod that fixes it!'  I think shipping a broken game is *never* the intent of a developer, but an unfortunate effect of the fact that software development is hard. newlinechar  newlinechar If any developer ever *does* ship a broken game, I think their reviews and sales will suffer accordingly, and shipping a broken game will never be profitable compared to shipping a functioning one (aside from cases where the thing that's broken is really unrealistic to fix, like was the case with Unity).  I also don't think this is unique to Bethesda. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe my support of his argument is colored by the fact that I already felt this was a non-issue before he spoke to it.  This same topic came up in this weeks Bombcast (from GiantBomb at 2:37:32) and IIRC Jeff Gerstmann (who, honestly, seems to have better insight into the ins and outs of game development than a large portion of the people commenting on this) discounted the idea citing consoles.  You can't rely on a paid mod fixing your console version, and for the vast majority of developers console sales are really where your priority lies.  Now for PC specific issues (like say Dark Souls and DSFix) that's another case, but like you said I think a free mod will exist to fix any of those issues.  And honestly, maybe we would have been better off *without* DSFix because then maybe From would have had to fix their broken game.
in Every friggin way possible, except there's no day night cycle, and if the mod doesn't exist, its coming.  
I'm half tempted to turn it off but I'm hoping maybe it will turn around..but I'm not thinking it is. Just so speechless over this episode can't even get over how bad it is. Thinking this is slowly coming to a end.
And also, let's consider the food industry, which fucking loves the obesity epidemic. Trust me. I see it first hand. Addictive food has never been so available. Yes, self control is obvious, and I am the fucking master of it at 6' 165 pounds and cut as fuck, but this is a bigger issue than just the medical industry and self control. If you don't recognize that there are literally trillions of dollars being made off the obese, you don't understand the problem.
